IndexINTRODUCTION
O ne day , my students sat me down and ordered me to write th is book.
They wa nted pe ople to be able to use our work to make their lives better . It
was som ething I ’d wanted to do for a long time, but it became my number
one priority .
My work is part of a tradition in psychology that shows the p ower of
people’ s beliefs.  These may be beliefs we’re aware of or unaware of, but
they stro ngly af fect what we w ant and whether we succeed i n getting it.
This trad ition al so shows how ch anging people’ s beliefs—even the simplest
beliefs—can have profound ef fects.
In th is book, yo u’ll learn how a simple belief about yourself— a belief
we disco vered in our research—guides a lar ge part of your life. In fact, it
permeates every  par t of your life. Much of w hat you think of as your
personality actu ally grows out of this “mindset.” Much of what may be
preventing you from fulfilling your potential grows out of it.
No book  has ever explained this mindset and shown people how to
make use of it in their lives. Y ou’ll suddenly understand the greats—in the
sciences and arts, in sports, and in business—and the would- have-beens.
Y ou’ll u nderstand your mate, your boss, your friends, your kids . Y ou’ll see
how to unleash your potential—and your children’ s.
It is my privilege to share my findings with you. Besides accounts of
people from my research, I’ve filled each chapter with stories both ripped
from the  headlin es and based on my own life and experience, so you can
see t he mindsets in action. (In m ost cases, names and personal information
have been changed to preserve  anonymity; in some cases, sev eral people
have be en condensed into one to make a clearer point. A num ber of the
exchanges are re-created from memory , and I have rendered them to the
best of my ability .)At t he end of each chapter and throughout the last chapter , I show you
ways to apply t he lessons—way s to recognize the mindset tha t is guiding
your life, to understand how it works, and to change it if you wish.
A little note abo ut grammar . I kn ow it and I love it, but I haven’ t always
followed it in this book. I start sentences with and s and but s. I end
sentences with prepositions. I us e the plural they  i n conte xts that  require the
singular he or she.  I’ ve done this fo r informality and immediacy , and I hope
that the sticklers will for give me.
A little note on this updated edition. I felt it was important to add new
information to some of the chapters. I added our new  study on
or ganizational m indsets to chapter 5  (Busine ss). Y es, a whole or gan ization
can have a min dset! I added a new section on “false growth mindset” to
chapter 7  (Parents, T eachers, and Coaches) after I learned about the many
creative ways people were interpreting and implementing the growth
mindset, not always accurately . And I added “The Journey to a (T rue)
Growth Mindset” to chapter 8  ( Ch anging Mindsets) because many people
have ask ed for more information on how to take that journey . I  hope these
updates are helpful.
I’d like to take this chance to thank all of the people who made my
research and this book possible. My students have made my research career
a complete joy . I hope they’ve  learned as much from me as I ’ve learned
from them. I’d also like to thank the or ganizations that sup ported our
research: the W illiam T . Grant Foundation, the National Science
Foundation, the Department of Education, the National Institute of Mental
Health, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the
Spencer Foundation, and the Raikes Foundation.
The people at R andom House have been the most encouraging  team I
could w ish for: W ebster Y ounce, Daniel Menaker , T om Perry , a nd, most of
all, Caro line Sutton and Jennifer Hershey , my editors. Y our excitement
about my book and your great suggestions have made all the dif ference. I
thank m y superb  agent, Giles A nderson, as well as Heidi Gran t for putting
me in touch with him.
Thanks to all th e people who g ave me input and feedback, bu t special
thanks to Polly Shulman, Richard Dweck, and Maryann Peshkin for their
extensive and insightful comme nts. Finally , I thank my husband , David, forthe love and enthusiasm that give my life an extra dimension. His support
throughout this project was extraordinary .
My work has b een about growth, and it has helped foster m y own
growth. It is my wish that it will do the same for you.Chapter 1
THE MINDSETS
W hen I was a young researcher , just starting out, something happe ned that
changed my life. I was obsessed  with understanding how people cope with
failures, and I d ecided to study it by watching how students g rapple with
hard problems. So I brought chil dren one at a time to a room in t heir school,
made them comfortable, and then gave them a series of puzzles to solve.
The first  ones were fairly easy , but the next ones were hard. As the students
grunted, perspired, and toiled, I watched their strategies and probed what
they were thinking and feeling.  I expected dif ferences among children in
how they coped with the dif ficulty , but I saw something I never expected.
Confronted with  the hard puzzles, one ten-year -old boy pulled up his
chair , rubbed his hands together , smacked his lips, and cried out, “I love a
challenge!” Another , sweating away on these puzzles, looked up with a
pleased expression and said with authority , “Y ou know , I was hoping  this
would be informative!”
What’ s w r ong w ith them?  I wondered. I always thought you coped with
failure or you di dn’ t cope with f ailure. I never thought anyone loved  failure.
W ere these alien children or were they on to something?
Everyone has a role model, someone who pointed the way at a  critical
moment in their lives. These children were my role models. They obviously
knew something I didn’ t and I was determined to figure  it out—to
understand the kind of mindset that could turn a failure into a gift.
What did they know? They knew that human qualities, such as
intellectual skill s, could be cultivated. And that’ s what they w ere doing—
getting smarter . Not only weren ’ t they discouraged by failure, they didn’ t
even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.I, on  the  other hand, thought human qualities were carved in sto ne. Y ou
were smart or you weren’ t, and failure meant you weren’ t. It was that
simple. If you could arrange successes and avoid failures (at all costs), you
could st ay smart. Struggles, mistakes, perseverance were just not part of
this picture.
Whether human qualities are things that can be cultivated or things that
are carved in stone is an old issue. What these beliefs mean for you is a new
one: What are the consequen ces of thinking that your inte lligence or
personality is something you can  develop, as opposed to someth ing that is a
fixed, deep-seated trait? Let’ s first look in on the age-old, fiercely waged
debate a bout hu man nature and then return to the question of what these
beliefs mean for you.
WHY DO PEOPLE DIFFER?
Since the dawn of time, people  have thought dif ferently , acted dif ferently ,
and fared dif ferently from eac h other . It was guaranteed th at someone
would ask the question of why people dif fered—why some people are
smarter or more moral—and whether there was something that made them
permanently dif ferent. Experts lined up on both sides. Some c laimed that
there was a st rong physical basis for these dif ferences, making them
unavoidable and unalterable. Through the ages, these alleged physical
dif ferences have included bumps on the skull (phrenology), the size and
shape of the skull (craniology), and, today , genes.
Others pointed to the strong dif ferences in people’ s backgrounds,
experiences, training, or ways of learning. It may surprise you to know that
a b ig champion of this view wa s Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test.
W asn’ t the IQ test meant to summarize children’ s unchangeable
intelligence? In fact, no. Binet, a Frenchman working in Paris in the early
twentieth century , designed thi s test to identify children who were not
profiting from the Paris public schools, so that new educational pr ograms
could be designed to get them back on track.  W ithou t denyin g individual
dif ferences in children’ s intellects, he believed that education and practice
could bring about fundamental c hanges in intelligence. Here is a quote from
one of his ma jor books, Modern Ideas About Childr en,  in which he
summarizes his work with hundreds of children with learning dif ficulties:A f ew modern philosophers . . . assert that an individ ual’ s
intelligence is a fixed quant ity , a quantity which cannot be
increased. W e must protest and react against this brutal pessimism. .
. .  W ith practic e, training, and above all, method, we manage to
increase our attention, our memory , our judgment and literally to
become more intelligent than we were before.
Who’ s r ight? T oday most experts agree that it’ s not either–or . It’ s not
nature or  nurture, genes or  env ironment. From conception on, there’ s a
constant give-and-take between the two. In fact, as Gilbert G ottlieb, an
eminent neurosc ientist, put it, not only do genes and environmen t cooperate
as we develop, but genes r equir e  inp ut from the  environment to work
properly .
At the same time, scientists are learning that people have more capacity
for lifelong learning and brain development than they ever thought. Of
course, each person has a unique genetic endowment. People ma y start with
dif ferent temperaments and dif ferent aptitudes, but it is clear that
experience, training, and perso nal ef fort take them the rest of the way .
Robert Sternber g , the present-day guru of intelligence, writes that the major
factor in whether people achieve expertise “is not some fixed prior ability ,
but purp oseful engagement.” Or , as his forerunner Binet recognized, it’ s not
always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.
WHA T DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR YOU? THE TWO MINDSETS
It’ s o ne thing to have pundits spouting their opinions about scien tific issues.
It’ s anot her thin g to understand how these views apply to you. For thirty
years, my research has shown that the view  you adopt for your self
profoundly af fec ts the way you lead your life. It can determine w hether you
become the person you want to be and whether you accomplish the things
you value. How does this happe n? How can a simple belief have the power
to transform your psychology and, as a result, your life?
Believing that your qualities are carved in stone—the fixed mindset—
creates an ur gency to prove yo urself over and over . If you have only a
certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality , and a certain moral
character—well, then you’d better prove that you have a heal thy dose ofthem. It simply wouldn’ t do to  look or feel deficient in these most basic
characteristics.
Some of us are  trained in this mindset from an early age. Ev en as a
child, I was focused on being smart, but the fixed mindset was really
stamped in by Mrs. W ilson, my  sixth-grade teacher . Unlike Alfred Binet,
she believed that people’ s IQ sc ores told the whole story of who they were.
W e were seated around the room in IQ order , and only the  highest-IQ
students could be trusted to carry the flag, clap the erasers, or take a note to
the principal. Aside from the daily stomachaches she provoked with her
judgmental stance, she was creating a mindset in which ever yone in the
class had one c onsuming goal—look smart, don’ t look dumb.  Who cared
about or enjoyed learning when our whole being was at stake every time
she gave us a test or called on us in class?
I’ve see n so many people with  this one consuming goal of proving
themselves—in the classroom, in their careers, and in their re lationships.
Every situation calls for a confi rmation of their intelligence, personality , or
character . Every  situation is evaluated: W ill I succeed or fail? W ill I lo ok
smart or dumb? W ill I be accepted or r ejected? W ill I feel like a winner or a
loser?
But doesn’ t our society value intelligence, personality , and character?
Isn’ t it normal to want these traits? Y es, but . . .
There’ s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand
you’re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and
others that you h ave a royal flus h when you’re secretly worried it’ s a pair of
tens. In this mindset, the hand  you’re dealt is just the starting point for
development. This gr owth mindset  is based on the belief that your basic
qualities are things you can cultivate through your ef forts, your strategies,
and help from o thers. Although  people may dif fer in every which way—in
their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can
change and grow through application and experience.
Do peop le with this mindset believe that anyone can be anything, that
anyone with proper motivation or education can become Einstein or
Beethoven? No,  but they believ e that a person’ s true potential is unknown
(and unknowable); that it’ s impossible to foresee what can be accomplished
with years of passion, toil, and training.Did you know that Darwin a nd T olstoy were considered ordinary
children? That Ben Hogan, on e of the greatest golfers of all time, was
completely uncoordinated and graceless as a child? That the photographer
Cindy Sherman, who has been on virtually every list of the most important
artists of the twentieth century , failed  h er first photog raphy course? That
Geraldine Page,  one of our greatest actresses, was advised to give it up for
lack of talent?
Y ou can  see how the belief that cherished qualities can be de veloped
creates a passion for learning. Why waste time proving over and over how
great yo u are, when you could  be getting better? Why hide deficiencies
instead o f overc oming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just
shore up  your self-esteem inste ad of ones who will also challenge you to
grow? A nd why  seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will
stretch y ou? The  passion for str etching yourself and sticking to it, even (or
especially) when  it’ s not going well, is the hallmark of the grow th mindset.
This is the mindset that allows  people to thrive during some of the most
challenging times in their lives.
A VIEW FROM THE TWO MINDSETS
T o give you a better sense of how the two mindsets work, i magine—as
vividly as you can—that you are a young adult having a really bad day:
One day , you go to a class that  is really important to you and that
you like a lot. The professor returns the midterm papers to the class.
Y ou got a C+. Y ou’re very disappointed. That evening on the way
back to your home, you find that you’ve gotten a parking ti cket.
Being really frustrated, you call your best friend to share your
experience but are sort of brushed of f.
What would you think? What would you feel? What would you do?
When I asked pe ople with the fi xed mindset, this is what they said: “I’d
feel like a reject.” “I’m a total failure.” “I’m an idiot.” “I’m a  loser .” “I’d
feel wor thless and dumb—every one’ s better than me.” “I’m slime.” In other
words, t hey’d see what happened as a direct measure of their competence
and worth.This is what the y’d think about their lives: “My life is pitiful.”  “I have
no life.”  “Some body upstairs doesn’ t like me.” “The world is  out to get
me.” “Someone is out to destroy me.” “Nobody loves me, everybody hates
me.” “Life is unfair and all ef forts are useless.” “Life stinks. I’m stupid.
Nothing good ever happens to me.” “I’m the most unlucky person on this
earth.”
Excuse me, was there death and destruction, or just a grade, a ticket, and
a bad phone call?
Are these just people with low self-esteem? Or card-carrying
pessimists? No. When they aren’ t coping with failure, they feel just as
worthy and optimistic—and bright and attractive—as people with the
growth mindset.
So how would they cope? “I wouldn’ t bother to put so much t ime and
ef fort into doing well in anything.” (In other words, don’ t let anyone
measure you again.) “Do nothin g.” “Stay in bed.” “Get drunk.” “Eat.” “Y ell
at so meone if I  get a chance to.” “Eat chocolate.” “Listen to  music and
pout.” “ Go into  my closet and  sit there.” “Pick a fight with somebody .”
“Cry .” “Break something.” “What is there to do?”
What is ther e to do!  Y ou know , when I wrote the vignette, I
intentionally made the grade a C+, not an F . It was a midterm rather than a
final. It was a parking ticket, not a car wreck. They were “sort of brushed
of f,” not rejected outright. Nothing catastrophic or irreversible happened.
Y et from thi s raw material the fixe d mindset created the feeling of utter
failure and paralysis.
When I gave people with the growth mindset the same vignette , here’ s
what they said. They’d think:
“I need to try harder in class, be more careful when parking the car , and
wonder if my friend had a bad day .”
“The C+ would tell me that I’d have to work a lot harder in the class,
but I have the rest of the semester to pull up my grade.”
There w ere man y , many more like this, but I think you get the idea.
Now , how would they cope? Directly .
“I’d start thinking about studyin g harder (or studying in a dif ferent way)
for my next test in that class, I’d pay the ticket, and I’d work things out with
my best friend the next time we speak.”“I’d look  at what was wrong on  my exam, resolve to do better , pay my
parking ticket, and call my friend to tell her I was upset the day before.”
“W ork h ard on my next paper , speak to the teacher , be more  careful
where I park or contest the ticket, and find out what’ s wron g with my
friend.”
Y ou don ’ t have  to have one mindset or the other to be upset. Who
wouldn’ t be? Things like a poor  grade or a rebuf f from a friend or loved one
—these are not fun events. No one was smacking their lips with relish. Y et
those pe ople with the growth mindset were not labeling themselves and
throwing up their hands. Even though they felt distressed, they were ready
to take the risks, confront the challenges, and keep working at them.
SO, WHA T’S NEW?
Is th is su ch a novel idea? W e ha ve lots of sayings that stress the importance
of ri sk and the power of persistence, such as “Nothing ventur ed, nothing
gained” and “If at first you don ’ t succeed, try , try again” or “Rome wasn’ t
built in a day .” (By the way , I was delighted to learn that the I talians have
the same  expres sion.) What is truly amazing is that people with the fixed
mindset would not agree. For t hem, it’ s “Nothing ventured, nothing lost.”
“If at first you don’ t succeed, you probably don’ t have the ability .” “If
Rome wasn’ t built in a day , maybe it wasn’ t meant to be.” In other words,
risk and  ef fort are two things tha t might reveal your inadequacies and show
that you were not up to the task. In fact, it’ s startling to see the degree to
which p eople with the fixed mi ndset do not believe in putting  in ef fort or
getting help.
What’ s also new is that people’ s  ideas about risk and ef fort grow out of
their more basic mindset. It’ s not just that some people happen to recognize
the value of ch allenging themselves and the importance of ef fort. Our
research has shown that this comes dir ectly  f rom the growth  mindset. When
we t each people the growth min dset, with its focus on development, these
ideas about challenge and ef for t follow . Similarly , it’ s not just that some
people h appen to dislike challenge and ef fort. When we (temporarily) put
people in a fixed mindset, with its focus on permanent traits, they quickly
fear challenge and devalue ef fort.W e often  see books with titles l ike The T en  Secr ets of the W orld’ s M ost
Successful People  cr owding the sh elves of bookstores, and these books may
give many useful tips. But they’re usually a list of unconnected pointers,
like “T ake more risks!” or “Believe in yourself!” While you’re left admiring
people who can do that, it’ s neve r clear how these things fit together or how
you cou ld ever become that wa y . So you’re inspired for a few days, but
basically the world’ s most successful people still have their secrets.
Instead, as you begin to understand the fixed and growth mindsets, you
will see exactly how one thing leads to another—how a belief that your
qualities are carved in stone le ads to a host of thoughts and a ctions, and
how a belief that your qualities can be cultivated leads to a host of dif ferent
thoughts and actions, taking you  down an entirely dif ferent road. It’ s what
we psychologists call an Aha!  exp erience. Not only have I seen this in my
research when we teach people a new mindset, but I get letters all the time
from people who have read my work.
They re cognize themselves: “A s I read your article I literally found
myself saying over and over again, ‘This is me, this is me!’ ” They see the
connections: “Y o ur article completely blew me away . I felt I had  discovered
the secret of the universe!” They feel their mindsets reorienting: “I can
certainly report a kind of pe rsonal revolution happening in my own
thinking, and this is an exciting feeling.” And they can put this new
thinking into practice for themselves and  oth ers: “Y our w ork has allowed
me to transform my work with children and see education through a
dif ferent lens,” or “I just wanted to let you know what an im pact—on a
personal and practical level—your outstanding research has had for
hundreds of students.” I get lots of these letters from coaches and business
leaders, too.
SELF-INSIGHT : WHO HAS ACCURA TE VIEWS OF THEIR ASSETS AND
LIMIT A TIONS?
W ell, m aybe the people with the growth mindset don’ t think they’re
Einstein or Beethoven, but aren’ t they more likely to have inflated views of
their abilities and try for things they’re not capable of? In fact, s tudies show
that people are terrible at estimating their abilities. Recently , we set out to
see who  is most likely to do this. Sure, we found that peo ple greatlymisestimated the ir performance  and their ability . But it was those with the
fixed mindset who accounted for almost all the inaccuracy .  The  peo ple with
the growth mindset were amazingly accurate.
When you think about it, this makes sense. If, like those with the growth
mindset, you believe you can develop yourself, then you’re open to accurate
information about your current abilities, even if it’ s unflattering. What’ s
more, if you’re oriented toward learning, as they are, you need  accurate
information about your curren t abilities in order to learn ef fectively .
However , if everything is either good news or bad news about your precious
traits—as it is with fixed-min dset people—distortion almost inevitably
enters the picture. Some outcomes are magnified, others are explained
away , and before you know it you don’ t know yourself at all.
Howard Gardner , in his book Extraor dinary Minds,  concluded that
exceptional indi viduals have “a special talent for identifying their own
strengths and weaknesses.” It’ s interesting that those with the growth
mindset seem to have that talent.
WHA T’S IN ST ORE
The other thing exceptional pe ople seem to have is a special talent for
converting life’ s setbacks into  future successes. Creativity researchers
concur . In a poll of 143  creativity researchers, there was wide agreem ent
about the number one ingredi ent in creative achievement. And it was
exactly the kind of perseverance and resilience produced by the growth
mindset.
Y ou may be asking again, How can one belief lead to all this—the love
of ch allenge, belief in effort, r esilience in the face of setbacks, and gr eater
(mor e cr eative!) success?  In the chapters that follow , you’ll see exactly how
this happ ens: ho w the mindsets c hange what people strive for an d what they
see a s success. H ow they change the definition, significance, an d impact of
failure. A nd how  they change th e deepest meaning of ef fort. Y ou ’ll see how
these mindsets play out in school, in sports, in the workplace, and in
relationships. Y ou’ll see where  they come from and how they can be
changed.Grow Y our Mindset
Which mindset do you have? Answer these questions about
intelligence. Read each statement and decide whether you mostly
agree with it or disagree with it.
1.    Y our intelligence is something very basic about you that you
can’ t change very much.
2.    Y ou can learn new things, but you can’ t really change how
intelligent you are.
3.    No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always
change it quite a bit.
4.    Y ou can always substantially change how intelligent you are.
Questions 1 and 2 are the fixed-mindset questions. Questions 3 and 4
reflect the growth mindset. Wh ich mindset did you agree with  more?
Y ou can be a mixture, but most people lean toward one or the other .
Y ou also have beliefs about ot her abilities. Y ou could substitute
“artistic talent,” “sports ability ,” or “business skill” for “intelligence.”
T ry it.
It’ s n ot only you r abilities; it’ s your personal qualities too. Look  at
these statements about personality and character and decide whether
you mostly agree or mostly disagree with each one.
1.    Y ou are a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can
be done to really change that.
2.    No matter what kind of person you are, you can always change
substantially .
3.    Y ou can do things dif ferently , but the important parts of who
you are can’ t really be changed.
4.    Y ou can always change basic things about the kind of person
you are.
Here, questions 1 and 3 are the fixed-mindset questions and
questions 2 and 4 reflect the growth mindset. Which did you  agree
with more?

IndexINTRODUCTION
O ne day , my students sat me down and ordered me to write th is book.
They wa nted pe ople to be able to use our work to make their lives better . It
was som ething I ’d wanted to do for a long time, but it became my number
one priority .
My work is part of a tradition in psychology that shows the p ower of
people’ s beliefs.  These may be beliefs we’re aware of or unaware of, but
they stro ngly af fect what we w ant and whether we succeed i n getting it.
This trad ition al so shows how ch anging people’ s beliefs—even the simplest
beliefs—can have profound ef fects.
In th is book, yo u’ll learn how a simple belief about yourself— a belief
we disco vered in our research—guides a lar ge part of your life. In fact, it
permeates every  par t of your life. Much of w hat you think of as your
personality actu ally grows out of this “mindset.” Much of what may be
preventing you from fulfilling your potential grows out of it.
No book  has ever explained this mindset and shown people how to
make use of it in their lives. Y ou’ll suddenly understand the greats—in the
sciences and arts, in sports, and in business—and the would- have-beens.
Y ou’ll u nderstand your mate, your boss, your friends, your kids . Y ou’ll see
how to unleash your potential—and your children’ s.
It is my privilege to share my findings with you. Besides accounts of
people from my research, I’ve filled each chapter with stories both ripped
from the  headlin es and based on my own life and experience, so you can
see t he mindsets in action. (In m ost cases, names and personal information
have been changed to preserve  anonymity; in some cases, sev eral people
have be en condensed into one to make a clearer point. A num ber of the
exchanges are re-created from memory , and I have rendered them to the
best of my ability .)At t he end of each chapter and throughout the last chapter , I show you
ways to apply t he lessons—way s to recognize the mindset tha t is guiding
your life, to understand how it works, and to change it if you wish.
A little note abo ut grammar . I kn ow it and I love it, but I haven’ t always
followed it in this book. I start sentences with and s and but s. I end
sentences with prepositions. I us e the plural they  i n conte xts that  require the
singular he or she.  I’ ve done this fo r informality and immediacy , and I hope
that the sticklers will for give me.
A little note on this updated edition. I felt it was important to add new
information to some of the chapters. I added our new  study on
or ganizational m indsets to chapter 5  (Busine ss). Y es, a whole or gan ization
can have a min dset! I added a new section on “false growth mindset” to
chapter 7  (Parents, T eachers, and Coaches) after I learned about the many
creative ways people were interpreting and implementing the growth
mindset, not always accurately . And I added “The Journey to a (T rue)
Growth Mindset” to chapter 8  ( Ch anging Mindsets) because many people
have ask ed for more information on how to take that journey . I  hope these
updates are helpful.
I’d like to take this chance to thank all of the people who made my
research and this book possible. My students have made my research career
a complete joy . I hope they’ve  learned as much from me as I ’ve learned
from them. I’d also like to thank the or ganizations that sup ported our
research: the W illiam T . Grant Foundation, the National Science
Foundation, the Department of Education, the National Institute of Mental
Health, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the
Spencer Foundation, and the Raikes Foundation.
The people at R andom House have been the most encouraging  team I
could w ish for: W ebster Y ounce, Daniel Menaker , T om Perry , a nd, most of
all, Caro line Sutton and Jennifer Hershey , my editors. Y our excitement
about my book and your great suggestions have made all the dif ference. I
thank m y superb  agent, Giles A nderson, as well as Heidi Gran t for putting
me in touch with him.
Thanks to all th e people who g ave me input and feedback, bu t special
thanks to Polly Shulman, Richard Dweck, and Maryann Peshkin for their
extensive and insightful comme nts. Finally , I thank my husband , David, forthe love and enthusiasm that give my life an extra dimension. His support
throughout this project was extraordinary .
My work has b een about growth, and it has helped foster m y own
growth. It is my wish that it will do the same for you.Chapter 1
THE MINDSETS
W hen I was a young researcher , just starting out, something happe ned that
changed my life. I was obsessed  with understanding how people cope with
failures, and I d ecided to study it by watching how students g rapple with
hard problems. So I brought chil dren one at a time to a room in t heir school,
made them comfortable, and then gave them a series of puzzles to solve.
The first  ones were fairly easy , but the next ones were hard. As the students
grunted, perspired, and toiled, I watched their strategies and probed what
they were thinking and feeling.  I expected dif ferences among children in
how they coped with the dif ficulty , but I saw something I never expected.
Confronted with  the hard puzzles, one ten-year -old boy pulled up his
chair , rubbed his hands together , smacked his lips, and cried out, “I love a
challenge!” Another , sweating away on these puzzles, looked up with a
pleased expression and said with authority , “Y ou know , I was hoping  this
would be informative!”
What’ s w r ong w ith them?  I wondered. I always thought you coped with
failure or you di dn’ t cope with f ailure. I never thought anyone loved  failure.
W ere these alien children or were they on to something?
Everyone has a role model, someone who pointed the way at a  critical
moment in their lives. These children were my role models. They obviously
knew something I didn’ t and I was determined to figure  it out—to
understand the kind of mindset that could turn a failure into a gift.
What did they know? They knew that human qualities, such as
intellectual skill s, could be cultivated. And that’ s what they w ere doing—
getting smarter . Not only weren ’ t they discouraged by failure, they didn’ t
even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.I, on  the  other hand, thought human qualities were carved in sto ne. Y ou
were smart or you weren’ t, and failure meant you weren’ t. It was that
simple. If you could arrange successes and avoid failures (at all costs), you
could st ay smart. Struggles, mistakes, perseverance were just not part of
this picture.
Whether human qualities are things that can be cultivated or things that
are carved in stone is an old issue. What these beliefs mean for you is a new
one: What are the consequen ces of thinking that your inte lligence or
personality is something you can  develop, as opposed to someth ing that is a
fixed, deep-seated trait? Let’ s first look in on the age-old, fiercely waged
debate a bout hu man nature and then return to the question of what these
beliefs mean for you.
WHY DO PEOPLE DIFFER?
Since the dawn of time, people  have thought dif ferently , acted dif ferently ,
and fared dif ferently from eac h other . It was guaranteed th at someone
would ask the question of why people dif fered—why some people are
smarter or more moral—and whether there was something that made them
permanently dif ferent. Experts lined up on both sides. Some c laimed that
there was a st rong physical basis for these dif ferences, making them
unavoidable and unalterable. Through the ages, these alleged physical
dif ferences have included bumps on the skull (phrenology), the size and
shape of the skull (craniology), and, today , genes.
Others pointed to the strong dif ferences in people’ s backgrounds,
experiences, training, or ways of learning. It may surprise you to know that
a b ig champion of this view wa s Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test.
W asn’ t the IQ test meant to summarize children’ s unchangeable
intelligence? In fact, no. Binet, a Frenchman working in Paris in the early
twentieth century , designed thi s test to identify children who were not
profiting from the Paris public schools, so that new educational pr ograms
could be designed to get them back on track.  W ithou t denyin g individual
dif ferences in children’ s intellects, he believed that education and practice
could bring about fundamental c hanges in intelligence. Here is a quote from
one of his ma jor books, Modern Ideas About Childr en,  in which he
summarizes his work with hundreds of children with learning dif ficulties:A f ew modern philosophers . . . assert that an individ ual’ s
intelligence is a fixed quant ity , a quantity which cannot be
increased. W e must protest and react against this brutal pessimism. .
. .  W ith practic e, training, and above all, method, we manage to
increase our attention, our memory , our judgment and literally to
become more intelligent than we were before.
Who’ s r ight? T oday most experts agree that it’ s not either–or . It’ s not
nature or  nurture, genes or  env ironment. From conception on, there’ s a
constant give-and-take between the two. In fact, as Gilbert G ottlieb, an
eminent neurosc ientist, put it, not only do genes and environmen t cooperate
as we develop, but genes r equir e  inp ut from the  environment to work
properly .
At the same time, scientists are learning that people have more capacity
for lifelong learning and brain development than they ever thought. Of
course, each person has a unique genetic endowment. People ma y start with
dif ferent temperaments and dif ferent aptitudes, but it is clear that
experience, training, and perso nal ef fort take them the rest of the way .
Robert Sternber g , the present-day guru of intelligence, writes that the major
factor in whether people achieve expertise “is not some fixed prior ability ,
but purp oseful engagement.” Or , as his forerunner Binet recognized, it’ s not
always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.
WHA T DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR YOU? THE TWO MINDSETS
It’ s o ne thing to have pundits spouting their opinions about scien tific issues.
It’ s anot her thin g to understand how these views apply to you. For thirty
years, my research has shown that the view  you adopt for your self
profoundly af fec ts the way you lead your life. It can determine w hether you
become the person you want to be and whether you accomplish the things
you value. How does this happe n? How can a simple belief have the power
to transform your psychology and, as a result, your life?
Believing that your qualities are carved in stone—the fixed mindset—
creates an ur gency to prove yo urself over and over . If you have only a
certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality , and a certain moral
character—well, then you’d better prove that you have a heal thy dose ofthem. It simply wouldn’ t do to  look or feel deficient in these most basic
characteristics.
Some of us are  trained in this mindset from an early age. Ev en as a
child, I was focused on being smart, but the fixed mindset was really
stamped in by Mrs. W ilson, my  sixth-grade teacher . Unlike Alfred Binet,
she believed that people’ s IQ sc ores told the whole story of who they were.
W e were seated around the room in IQ order , and only the  highest-IQ
students could be trusted to carry the flag, clap the erasers, or take a note to
the principal. Aside from the daily stomachaches she provoked with her
judgmental stance, she was creating a mindset in which ever yone in the
class had one c onsuming goal—look smart, don’ t look dumb.  Who cared
about or enjoyed learning when our whole being was at stake every time
she gave us a test or called on us in class?
I’ve see n so many people with  this one consuming goal of proving
themselves—in the classroom, in their careers, and in their re lationships.
Every situation calls for a confi rmation of their intelligence, personality , or
character . Every  situation is evaluated: W ill I succeed or fail? W ill I lo ok
smart or dumb? W ill I be accepted or r ejected? W ill I feel like a winner or a
loser?
But doesn’ t our society value intelligence, personality , and character?
Isn’ t it normal to want these traits? Y es, but . . .
There’ s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand
you’re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and
others that you h ave a royal flus h when you’re secretly worried it’ s a pair of
tens. In this mindset, the hand  you’re dealt is just the starting point for
development. This gr owth mindset  is based on the belief that your basic
qualities are things you can cultivate through your ef forts, your strategies,
and help from o thers. Although  people may dif fer in every which way—in
their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can
change and grow through application and experience.
Do peop le with this mindset believe that anyone can be anything, that
anyone with proper motivation or education can become Einstein or
Beethoven? No,  but they believ e that a person’ s true potential is unknown
(and unknowable); that it’ s impossible to foresee what can be accomplished
with years of passion, toil, and training.Did you know that Darwin a nd T olstoy were considered ordinary
children? That Ben Hogan, on e of the greatest golfers of all time, was
completely uncoordinated and graceless as a child? That the photographer
Cindy Sherman, who has been on virtually every list of the most important
artists of the twentieth century , failed  h er first photog raphy course? That
Geraldine Page,  one of our greatest actresses, was advised to give it up for
lack of talent?
Y ou can  see how the belief that cherished qualities can be de veloped
creates a passion for learning. Why waste time proving over and over how
great yo u are, when you could  be getting better? Why hide deficiencies
instead o f overc oming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just
shore up  your self-esteem inste ad of ones who will also challenge you to
grow? A nd why  seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will
stretch y ou? The  passion for str etching yourself and sticking to it, even (or
especially) when  it’ s not going well, is the hallmark of the grow th mindset.
This is the mindset that allows  people to thrive during some of the most
challenging times in their lives.
A VIEW FROM THE TWO MINDSETS
T o give you a better sense of how the two mindsets work, i magine—as
vividly as you can—that you are a young adult having a really bad day:
One day , you go to a class that  is really important to you and that
you like a lot. The professor returns the midterm papers to the class.
Y ou got a C+. Y ou’re very disappointed. That evening on the way
back to your home, you find that you’ve gotten a parking ti cket.
Being really frustrated, you call your best friend to share your
experience but are sort of brushed of f.
What would you think? What would you feel? What would you do?
When I asked pe ople with the fi xed mindset, this is what they said: “I’d
feel like a reject.” “I’m a total failure.” “I’m an idiot.” “I’m a  loser .” “I’d
feel wor thless and dumb—every one’ s better than me.” “I’m slime.” In other
words, t hey’d see what happened as a direct measure of their competence
and worth.This is what the y’d think about their lives: “My life is pitiful.”  “I have
no life.”  “Some body upstairs doesn’ t like me.” “The world is  out to get
me.” “Someone is out to destroy me.” “Nobody loves me, everybody hates
me.” “Life is unfair and all ef forts are useless.” “Life stinks. I’m stupid.
Nothing good ever happens to me.” “I’m the most unlucky person on this
earth.”
Excuse me, was there death and destruction, or just a grade, a ticket, and
a bad phone call?
Are these just people with low self-esteem? Or card-carrying
pessimists? No. When they aren’ t coping with failure, they feel just as
worthy and optimistic—and bright and attractive—as people with the
growth mindset.
So how would they cope? “I wouldn’ t bother to put so much t ime and
ef fort into doing well in anything.” (In other words, don’ t let anyone
measure you again.) “Do nothin g.” “Stay in bed.” “Get drunk.” “Eat.” “Y ell
at so meone if I  get a chance to.” “Eat chocolate.” “Listen to  music and
pout.” “ Go into  my closet and  sit there.” “Pick a fight with somebody .”
“Cry .” “Break something.” “What is there to do?”
What is ther e to do!  Y ou know , when I wrote the vignette, I
intentionally made the grade a C+, not an F . It was a midterm rather than a
final. It was a parking ticket, not a car wreck. They were “sort of brushed
of f,” not rejected outright. Nothing catastrophic or irreversible happened.
Y et from thi s raw material the fixe d mindset created the feeling of utter
failure and paralysis.
When I gave people with the growth mindset the same vignette , here’ s
what they said. They’d think:
“I need to try harder in class, be more careful when parking the car , and
wonder if my friend had a bad day .”
“The C+ would tell me that I’d have to work a lot harder in the class,
but I have the rest of the semester to pull up my grade.”
There w ere man y , many more like this, but I think you get the idea.
Now , how would they cope? Directly .
“I’d start thinking about studyin g harder (or studying in a dif ferent way)
for my next test in that class, I’d pay the ticket, and I’d work things out with
my best friend the next time we speak.”“I’d look  at what was wrong on  my exam, resolve to do better , pay my
parking ticket, and call my friend to tell her I was upset the day before.”
“W ork h ard on my next paper , speak to the teacher , be more  careful
where I park or contest the ticket, and find out what’ s wron g with my
friend.”
Y ou don ’ t have  to have one mindset or the other to be upset. Who
wouldn’ t be? Things like a poor  grade or a rebuf f from a friend or loved one
—these are not fun events. No one was smacking their lips with relish. Y et
those pe ople with the growth mindset were not labeling themselves and
throwing up their hands. Even though they felt distressed, they were ready
to take the risks, confront the challenges, and keep working at them.
SO, WHA T’S NEW?
Is th is su ch a novel idea? W e ha ve lots of sayings that stress the importance
of ri sk and the power of persistence, such as “Nothing ventur ed, nothing
gained” and “If at first you don ’ t succeed, try , try again” or “Rome wasn’ t
built in a day .” (By the way , I was delighted to learn that the I talians have
the same  expres sion.) What is truly amazing is that people with the fixed
mindset would not agree. For t hem, it’ s “Nothing ventured, nothing lost.”
“If at first you don’ t succeed, you probably don’ t have the ability .” “If
Rome wasn’ t built in a day , maybe it wasn’ t meant to be.” In other words,
risk and  ef fort are two things tha t might reveal your inadequacies and show
that you were not up to the task. In fact, it’ s startling to see the degree to
which p eople with the fixed mi ndset do not believe in putting  in ef fort or
getting help.
What’ s also new is that people’ s  ideas about risk and ef fort grow out of
their more basic mindset. It’ s not just that some people happen to recognize
the value of ch allenging themselves and the importance of ef fort. Our
research has shown that this comes dir ectly  f rom the growth  mindset. When
we t each people the growth min dset, with its focus on development, these
ideas about challenge and ef for t follow . Similarly , it’ s not just that some
people h appen to dislike challenge and ef fort. When we (temporarily) put
people in a fixed mindset, with its focus on permanent traits, they quickly
fear challenge and devalue ef fort.W e often  see books with titles l ike The T en  Secr ets of the W orld’ s M ost
Successful People  cr owding the sh elves of bookstores, and these books may
give many useful tips. But they’re usually a list of unconnected pointers,
like “T ake more risks!” or “Believe in yourself!” While you’re left admiring
people who can do that, it’ s neve r clear how these things fit together or how
you cou ld ever become that wa y . So you’re inspired for a few days, but
basically the world’ s most successful people still have their secrets.
Instead, as you begin to understand the fixed and growth mindsets, you
will see exactly how one thing leads to another—how a belief that your
qualities are carved in stone le ads to a host of thoughts and a ctions, and
how a belief that your qualities can be cultivated leads to a host of dif ferent
thoughts and actions, taking you  down an entirely dif ferent road. It’ s what
we psychologists call an Aha!  exp erience. Not only have I seen this in my
research when we teach people a new mindset, but I get letters all the time
from people who have read my work.
They re cognize themselves: “A s I read your article I literally found
myself saying over and over again, ‘This is me, this is me!’ ” They see the
connections: “Y o ur article completely blew me away . I felt I had  discovered
the secret of the universe!” They feel their mindsets reorienting: “I can
certainly report a kind of pe rsonal revolution happening in my own
thinking, and this is an exciting feeling.” And they can put this new
thinking into practice for themselves and  oth ers: “Y our w ork has allowed
me to transform my work with children and see education through a
dif ferent lens,” or “I just wanted to let you know what an im pact—on a
personal and practical level—your outstanding research has had for
hundreds of students.” I get lots of these letters from coaches and business
leaders, too.
SELF-INSIGHT : WHO HAS ACCURA TE VIEWS OF THEIR ASSETS AND
LIMIT A TIONS?
W ell, m aybe the people with the growth mindset don’ t think they’re
Einstein or Beethoven, but aren’ t they more likely to have inflated views of
their abilities and try for things they’re not capable of? In fact, s tudies show
that people are terrible at estimating their abilities. Recently , we set out to
see who  is most likely to do this. Sure, we found that peo ple greatlymisestimated the ir performance  and their ability . But it was those with the
fixed mindset who accounted for almost all the inaccuracy .  The  peo ple with
the growth mindset were amazingly accurate.
When you think about it, this makes sense. If, like those with the growth
mindset, you believe you can develop yourself, then you’re open to accurate
information about your current abilities, even if it’ s unflattering. What’ s
more, if you’re oriented toward learning, as they are, you need  accurate
information about your curren t abilities in order to learn ef fectively .
However , if everything is either good news or bad news about your precious
traits—as it is with fixed-min dset people—distortion almost inevitably
enters the picture. Some outcomes are magnified, others are explained
away , and before you know it you don’ t know yourself at all.
Howard Gardner , in his book Extraor dinary Minds,  concluded that
exceptional indi viduals have “a special talent for identifying their own
strengths and weaknesses.” It’ s interesting that those with the growth
mindset seem to have that talent.
WHA T’S IN ST ORE
The other thing exceptional pe ople seem to have is a special talent for
converting life’ s setbacks into  future successes. Creativity researchers
concur . In a poll of 143  creativity researchers, there was wide agreem ent
about the number one ingredi ent in creative achievement. And it was
exactly the kind of perseverance and resilience produced by the growth
mindset.
Y ou may be asking again, How can one belief lead to all this—the love
of ch allenge, belief in effort, r esilience in the face of setbacks, and gr eater
(mor e cr eative!) success?  In the chapters that follow , you’ll see exactly how
this happ ens: ho w the mindsets c hange what people strive for an d what they
see a s success. H ow they change the definition, significance, an d impact of
failure. A nd how  they change th e deepest meaning of ef fort. Y ou ’ll see how
these mindsets play out in school, in sports, in the workplace, and in
relationships. Y ou’ll see where  they come from and how they can be
changed.Grow Y our Mindset
Which mindset do you have? Answer these questions about
intelligence. Read each statement and decide whether you mostly
agree with it or disagree with it.
1.    Y our intelligence is something very basic about you that you
can’ t change very much.
2.    Y ou can learn new things, but you can’ t really change how
intelligent you are.
3.    No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always
change it quite a bit.
4.    Y ou can always substantially change how intelligent you are.
Questions 1 and 2 are the fixed-mindset questions. Questions 3 and 4
reflect the growth mindset. Wh ich mindset did you agree with  more?
Y ou can be a mixture, but most people lean toward one or the other .
Y ou also have beliefs about ot her abilities. Y ou could substitute
“artistic talent,” “sports ability ,” or “business skill” for “intelligence.”
T ry it.
It’ s n ot only you r abilities; it’ s your personal qualities too. Look  at
these statements about personality and character and decide whether
you mostly agree or mostly disagree with each one.
1.    Y ou are a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can
be done to really change that.
2.    No matter what kind of person you are, you can always change
substantially .
3.    Y ou can do things dif ferently , but the important parts of who
you are can’ t really be changed.
4.    Y ou can always change basic things about the kind of person
you are.
Here, questions 1 and 3 are the fixed-mindset questions and
questions 2 and 4 reflect the growth mindset. Which did you  agree
with more?

IndexINTRODUCTION
O ne day , my students sat me down and ordered me to write th is book.
They wa nted pe ople to be able to use our work to make their lives better . It
was som ething I â€™d wanted to do for a long time, but it became my number
one priority .
My work is part of a tradition in psychology that shows the p ower of
peopleâ€™ s beliefs.  These may be beliefs weâ€™re aware of or unaware of, but
they stro ngly af fect what we w ant and whether we succeed i n getting it.
This trad ition al so shows how ch anging peopleâ€™ s beliefsâ€”even the simplest
beliefsâ€”can have profound ef fects.
In th is book, yo uâ€™ll learn how a simple belief about yourselfâ€” a belief
we disco vered in our researchâ€”guides a lar ge part of your life. In fact, it
permeates every  par t of your life. Much of w hat you think of as your
personality actu ally grows out of this â€œmindset.â€ Much of what may be
preventing you from fulfilling your potential grows out of it.
No book  has ever explained this mindset and shown people how to
make use of it in their lives. Y ouâ€™ll suddenly understand the greatsâ€”in the
sciences and arts, in sports, and in businessâ€”and the would- have-beens.
Y ouâ€™ll u nderstand your mate, your boss, your friends, your kids . Y ouâ€™ll see
how to unleash your potentialâ€”and your childrenâ€™ s.
It is my privilege to share my findings with you. Besides accounts of
people from my research, Iâ€™ve filled each chapter with stories both ripped
from the  headlin es and based on my own life and experience, so you can
see t he mindsets in action. (In m ost cases, names and personal information
have been changed to preserve  anonymity; in some cases, sev eral people
have be en condensed into one to make a clearer point. A num ber of the
exchanges are re-created from memory , and I have rendered them to the
best of my ability .)At t he end of each chapter and throughout the last chapter , I show you
ways to apply t he lessonsâ€”way s to recognize the mindset tha t is guiding
your life, to understand how it works, and to change it if you wish.
A little note abo ut grammar . I kn ow it and I love it, but I havenâ€™ t always
followed it in this book. I start sentences with and s and but s. I end
sentences with prepositions. I us e the plural they  i n conte xts that  require the
singular he or she.  Iâ€™ ve done this fo r informality and immediacy , and I hope
that the sticklers will for give me.
A little note on this updated edition. I felt it was important to add new
information to some of the chapters. I added our new  study on
or ganizational m indsets to chapter 5  (Busine ss). Y es, a whole or gan ization
can have a min dset! I added a new section on â€œfalse growth mindsetâ€ to
chapter 7  (Parents, T eachers, and Coaches) after I learned about the many
creative ways people were interpreting and implementing the growth
mindset, not always accurately . And I added â€œThe Journey to a (T rue)
Growth Mindsetâ€ to chapter 8  ( Ch anging Mindsets) because many people
have ask ed for more information on how to take that journey . I  hope these
updates are helpful.
Iâ€™d like to take this chance to thank all of the people who made my
research and this book possible. My students have made my research career
a complete joy . I hope theyâ€™ve  learned as much from me as I â€™ve learned
from them. Iâ€™d also like to thank the or ganizations that sup ported our
research: the W illiam T . Grant Foundation, the National Science
Foundation, the Department of Education, the National Institute of Mental
Health, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the
Spencer Foundation, and the Raikes Foundation.
The people at R andom House have been the most encouraging  team I
could w ish for: W ebster Y ounce, Daniel Menaker , T om Perry , a nd, most of
all, Caro line Sutton and Jennifer Hershey , my editors. Y our excitement
about my book and your great suggestions have made all the dif ference. I
thank m y superb  agent, Giles A nderson, as well as Heidi Gran t for putting
me in touch with him.
Thanks to all th e people who g ave me input and feedback, bu t special
thanks to Polly Shulman, Richard Dweck, and Maryann Peshkin for their
extensive and insightful comme nts. Finally , I thank my husband , David, forthe love and enthusiasm that give my life an extra dimension. His support
throughout this project was extraordinary .
My work has b een about growth, and it has helped foster m y own
growth. It is my wish that it will do the same for you.Chapter 1
THE MINDSETS
W hen I was a young researcher , just starting out, something happe ned that
changed my life. I was obsessed  with understanding how people cope with
failures, and I d ecided to study it by watching how students g rapple with
hard problems. So I brought chil dren one at a time to a room in t heir school,
made them comfortable, and then gave them a series of puzzles to solve.
The first  ones were fairly easy , but the next ones were hard. As the students
grunted, perspired, and toiled, I watched their strategies and probed what
they were thinking and feeling.  I expected dif ferences among children in
how they coped with the dif ficulty , but I saw something I never expected.
Confronted with  the hard puzzles, one ten-year -old boy pulled up his
chair , rubbed his hands together , smacked his lips, and cried out, â€œI love a
challenge!â€ Another , sweating away on these puzzles, looked up with a
pleased expression and said with authority , â€œY ou know , I was hoping  this
would be informative!â€
Whatâ€™ s w r ong w ith them?  I wondered. I always thought you coped with
failure or you di dnâ€™ t cope with f ailure. I never thought anyone loved  failure.
W ere these alien children or were they on to something?
Everyone has a role model, someone who pointed the way at a  critical
moment in their lives. These children were my role models. They obviously
knew something I didnâ€™ t and I was determined to figure  it outâ€”to
understand the kind of mindset that could turn a failure into a gift.
What did they know? They knew that human qualities, such as
intellectual skill s, could be cultivated. And thatâ€™ s what they w ere doingâ€”
getting smarter . Not only weren â€™ t they discouraged by failure, they didnâ€™ t
even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.I, on  the  other hand, thought human qualities were carved in sto ne. Y ou
were smart or you werenâ€™ t, and failure meant you werenâ€™ t. It was that
simple. If you could arrange successes and avoid failures (at all costs), you
could st ay smart. Struggles, mistakes, perseverance were just not part of
this picture.
Whether human qualities are things that can be cultivated or things that
are carved in stone is an old issue. What these beliefs mean for you is a new
one: What are the consequen ces of thinking that your inte lligence or
personality is something you can  develop, as opposed to someth ing that is a
fixed, deep-seated trait? Letâ€™ s first look in on the age-old, fiercely waged
debate a bout hu man nature and then return to the question of what these
beliefs mean for you.
WHY DO PEOPLE DIFFER?
Since the dawn of time, people  have thought dif ferently , acted dif ferently ,
and fared dif ferently from eac h other . It was guaranteed th at someone
would ask the question of why people dif feredâ€”why some people are
smarter or more moralâ€”and whether there was something that made them
permanently dif ferent. Experts lined up on both sides. Some c laimed that
there was a st rong physical basis for these dif ferences, making them
unavoidable and unalterable. Through the ages, these alleged physical
dif ferences have included bumps on the skull (phrenology), the size and
shape of the skull (craniology), and, today , genes.
Others pointed to the strong dif ferences in peopleâ€™ s backgrounds,
experiences, training, or ways of learning. It may surprise you to know that
a b ig champion of this view wa s Alfred Binet, the inventor of the IQ test.
W asnâ€™ t the IQ test meant to summarize childrenâ€™ s unchangeable
intelligence? In fact, no. Binet, a Frenchman working in Paris in the early
twentieth century , designed thi s test to identify children who were not
profiting from the Paris public schools, so that new educational pr ograms
could be designed to get them back on track.  W ithou t denyin g individual
dif ferences in childrenâ€™ s intellects, he believed that education and practice
could bring about fundamental c hanges in intelligence. Here is a quote from
one of his ma jor books, Modern Ideas About Childr en,  in which he
summarizes his work with hundreds of children with learning dif ficulties:A f ew modern philosophers . . . assert that an individ ualâ€™ s
intelligence is a fixed quant ity , a quantity which cannot be
increased. W e must protest and react against this brutal pessimism. .
. .  W ith practic e, training, and above all, method, we manage to
increase our attention, our memory , our judgment and literally to
become more intelligent than we were before.
Whoâ€™ s r ight? T oday most experts agree that itâ€™ s not eitherâ€“or . Itâ€™ s not
nature or  nurture, genes or  env ironment. From conception on, thereâ€™ s a
constant give-and-take between the two. In fact, as Gilbert G ottlieb, an
eminent neurosc ientist, put it, not only do genes and environmen t cooperate
as we develop, but genes r equir e  inp ut from the  environment to work
properly .
At the same time, scientists are learning that people have more capacity
for lifelong learning and brain development than they ever thought. Of
course, each person has a unique genetic endowment. People ma y start with
dif ferent temperaments and dif ferent aptitudes, but it is clear that
experience, training, and perso nal ef fort take them the rest of the way .
Robert Sternber g , the present-day guru of intelligence, writes that the major
factor in whether people achieve expertise â€œis not some fixed prior ability ,
but purp oseful engagement.â€ Or , as his forerunner Binet recognized, itâ€™ s not
always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.
WHA T DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR YOU? THE TWO MINDSETS
Itâ€™ s o ne thing to have pundits spouting their opinions about scien tific issues.
Itâ€™ s anot her thin g to understand how these views apply to you. For thirty
years, my research has shown that the view  you adopt for your self
profoundly af fec ts the way you lead your life. It can determine w hether you
become the person you want to be and whether you accomplish the things
you value. How does this happe n? How can a simple belief have the power
to transform your psychology and, as a result, your life?
Believing that your qualities are carved in stoneâ€”the fixed mindsetâ€”
creates an ur gency to prove yo urself over and over . If you have only a
certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality , and a certain moral
characterâ€”well, then youâ€™d better prove that you have a heal thy dose ofthem. It simply wouldnâ€™ t do to  look or feel deficient in these most basic
characteristics.
Some of us are  trained in this mindset from an early age. Ev en as a
child, I was focused on being smart, but the fixed mindset was really
stamped in by Mrs. W ilson, my  sixth-grade teacher . Unlike Alfred Binet,
she believed that peopleâ€™ s IQ sc ores told the whole story of who they were.
W e were seated around the room in IQ order , and only the  highest-IQ
students could be trusted to carry the flag, clap the erasers, or take a note to
the principal. Aside from the daily stomachaches she provoked with her
judgmental stance, she was creating a mindset in which ever yone in the
class had one c onsuming goalâ€”look smart, donâ€™ t look dumb.  Who cared
about or enjoyed learning when our whole being was at stake every time
she gave us a test or called on us in class?
Iâ€™ve see n so many people with  this one consuming goal of proving
themselvesâ€”in the classroom, in their careers, and in their re lationships.
Every situation calls for a confi rmation of their intelligence, personality , or
character . Every  situation is evaluated: W ill I succeed or fail? W ill I lo ok
smart or dumb? W ill I be accepted or r ejected? W ill I feel like a winner or a
loser?
But doesnâ€™ t our society value intelligence, personality , and character?
Isnâ€™ t it normal to want these traits? Y es, but . . .
Thereâ€™ s another mindset in which these traits are not simply a hand
youâ€™re dealt and have to live with, always trying to convince yourself and
others that you h ave a royal flus h when youâ€™re secretly worried itâ€™ s a pair of
tens. In this mindset, the hand  youâ€™re dealt is just the starting point for
development. This gr owth mindset  is based on the belief that your basic
qualities are things you can cultivate through your ef forts, your strategies,
and help from o thers. Although  people may dif fer in every which wayâ€”in
their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperamentsâ€”everyone can
change and grow through application and experience.
Do peop le with this mindset believe that anyone can be anything, that
anyone with proper motivation or education can become Einstein or
Beethoven? No,  but they believ e that a personâ€™ s true potential is unknown
(and unknowable); that itâ€™ s impossible to foresee what can be accomplished
with years of passion, toil, and training.Did you know that Darwin a nd T olstoy were considered ordinary
children? That Ben Hogan, on e of the greatest golfers of all time, was
completely uncoordinated and graceless as a child? That the photographer
Cindy Sherman, who has been on virtually every list of the most important
artists of the twentieth century , failed  h er first photog raphy course? That
Geraldine Page,  one of our greatest actresses, was advised to give it up for
lack of talent?
Y ou can  see how the belief that cherished qualities can be de veloped
creates a passion for learning. Why waste time proving over and over how
great yo u are, when you could  be getting better? Why hide deficiencies
instead o f overc oming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just
shore up  your self-esteem inste ad of ones who will also challenge you to
grow? A nd why  seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will
stretch y ou? The  passion for str etching yourself and sticking to it, even (or
especially) when  itâ€™ s not going well, is the hallmark of the grow th mindset.
This is the mindset that allows  people to thrive during some of the most
challenging times in their lives.
A VIEW FROM THE TWO MINDSETS
T o give you a better sense of how the two mindsets work, i magineâ€”as
vividly as you canâ€”that you are a young adult having a really bad day:
One day , you go to a class that  is really important to you and that
you like a lot. The professor returns the midterm papers to the class.
Y ou got a C+. Y ouâ€™re very disappointed. That evening on the way
back to your home, you find that youâ€™ve gotten a parking ti cket.
Being really frustrated, you call your best friend to share your
experience but are sort of brushed of f.
What would you think? What would you feel? What would you do?
When I asked pe ople with the fi xed mindset, this is what they said: â€œIâ€™d
feel like a reject.â€ â€œIâ€™m a total failure.â€ â€œIâ€™m an idiot.â€ â€œIâ€™m a  loser .â€ â€œIâ€™d
feel wor thless and dumbâ€”every oneâ€™ s better than me.â€ â€œIâ€™m slime.â€ In other
words, t heyâ€™d see what happened as a direct measure of their competence
and worth.This is what the yâ€™d think about their lives: â€œMy life is pitiful.â€  â€œI have
no life.â€  â€œSome body upstairs doesnâ€™ t like me.â€ â€œThe world is  out to get
me.â€ â€œSomeone is out to destroy me.â€ â€œNobody loves me, everybody hates
me.â€ â€œLife is unfair and all ef forts are useless.â€ â€œLife stinks. Iâ€™m stupid.
Nothing good ever happens to me.â€ â€œIâ€™m the most unlucky person on this
earth.â€
Excuse me, was there death and destruction, or just a grade, a ticket, and
a bad phone call?
Are these just people with low self-esteem? Or card-carrying
pessimists? No. When they arenâ€™ t coping with failure, they feel just as
worthy and optimisticâ€”and bright and attractiveâ€”as people with the
growth mindset.
So how would they cope? â€œI wouldnâ€™ t bother to put so much t ime and
ef fort into doing well in anything.â€ (In other words, donâ€™ t let anyone
measure you again.) â€œDo nothin g.â€ â€œStay in bed.â€ â€œGet drunk.â€ â€œEat.â€ â€œY ell
at so meone if I  get a chance to.â€ â€œEat chocolate.â€ â€œListen to  music and
pout.â€ â€œ Go into  my closet and  sit there.â€ â€œPick a fight with somebody .â€
â€œCry .â€ â€œBreak something.â€ â€œWhat is there to do?â€
What is ther e to do!  Y ou know , when I wrote the vignette, I
intentionally made the grade a C+, not an F . It was a midterm rather than a
final. It was a parking ticket, not a car wreck. They were â€œsort of brushed
of f,â€ not rejected outright. Nothing catastrophic or irreversible happened.
Y et from thi s raw material the fixe d mindset created the feeling of utter
failure and paralysis.
When I gave people with the growth mindset the same vignette , hereâ€™ s
what they said. Theyâ€™d think:
â€œI need to try harder in class, be more careful when parking the car , and
wonder if my friend had a bad day .â€
â€œThe C+ would tell me that Iâ€™d have to work a lot harder in the class,
but I have the rest of the semester to pull up my grade.â€
There w ere man y , many more like this, but I think you get the idea.
Now , how would they cope? Directly .
â€œIâ€™d start thinking about studyin g harder (or studying in a dif ferent way)
for my next test in that class, Iâ€™d pay the ticket, and Iâ€™d work things out with
my best friend the next time we speak.â€â€œIâ€™d look  at what was wrong on  my exam, resolve to do better , pay my
parking ticket, and call my friend to tell her I was upset the day before.â€
â€œW ork h ard on my next paper , speak to the teacher , be more  careful
where I park or contest the ticket, and find out whatâ€™ s wron g with my
friend.â€
Y ou don â€™ t have  to have one mindset or the other to be upset. Who
wouldnâ€™ t be? Things like a poor  grade or a rebuf f from a friend or loved one
â€”these are not fun events. No one was smacking their lips with relish. Y et
those pe ople with the growth mindset were not labeling themselves and
throwing up their hands. Even though they felt distressed, they were ready
to take the risks, confront the challenges, and keep working at them.
SO, WHA Tâ€™S NEW?
Is th is su ch a novel idea? W e ha ve lots of sayings that stress the importance
of ri sk and the power of persistence, such as â€œNothing ventur ed, nothing
gainedâ€ and â€œIf at first you don â€™ t succeed, try , try againâ€ or â€œRome wasnâ€™ t
built in a day .â€ (By the way , I was delighted to learn that the I talians have
the same  expres sion.) What is truly amazing is that people with the fixed
mindset would not agree. For t hem, itâ€™ s â€œNothing ventured, nothing lost.â€
â€œIf at first you donâ€™ t succeed, you probably donâ€™ t have the ability .â€ â€œIf
Rome wasnâ€™ t built in a day , maybe it wasnâ€™ t meant to be.â€ In other words,
risk and  ef fort are two things tha t might reveal your inadequacies and show
that you were not up to the task. In fact, itâ€™ s startling to see the degree to
which p eople with the fixed mi ndset do not believe in putting  in ef fort or
getting help.
Whatâ€™ s also new is that peopleâ€™ s  ideas about risk and ef fort grow out of
their more basic mindset. Itâ€™ s not just that some people happen to recognize
the value of ch allenging themselves and the importance of ef fort. Our
research has shown that this comes dir ectly  f rom the growth  mindset. When
we t each people the growth min dset, with its focus on development, these
ideas about challenge and ef for t follow . Similarly , itâ€™ s not just that some
people h appen to dislike challenge and ef fort. When we (temporarily) put
people in a fixed mindset, with its focus on permanent traits, they quickly
fear challenge and devalue ef fort.W e often  see books with titles l ike The T en  Secr ets of the W orldâ€™ s M ost
Successful People  cr owding the sh elves of bookstores, and these books may
give many useful tips. But theyâ€™re usually a list of unconnected pointers,
like â€œT ake more risks!â€ or â€œBelieve in yourself!â€ While youâ€™re left admiring
people who can do that, itâ€™ s neve r clear how these things fit together or how
you cou ld ever become that wa y . So youâ€™re inspired for a few days, but
basically the worldâ€™ s most successful people still have their secrets.
Instead, as you begin to understand the fixed and growth mindsets, you
will see exactly how one thing leads to anotherâ€”how a belief that your
qualities are carved in stone le ads to a host of thoughts and a ctions, and
how a belief that your qualities can be cultivated leads to a host of dif ferent
thoughts and actions, taking you  down an entirely dif ferent road. Itâ€™ s what
we psychologists call an Aha!  exp erience. Not only have I seen this in my
research when we teach people a new mindset, but I get letters all the time
from people who have read my work.
They re cognize themselves: â€œA s I read your article I literally found
myself saying over and over again, â€˜This is me, this is me!â€™ â€ They see the
connections: â€œY o ur article completely blew me away . I felt I had  discovered
the secret of the universe!â€ They feel their mindsets reorienting: â€œI can
certainly report a kind of pe rsonal revolution happening in my own
thinking, and this is an exciting feeling.â€ And they can put this new
thinking into practice for themselves and  oth ers: â€œY our w ork has allowed
me to transform my work with children and see education through a
dif ferent lens,â€ or â€œI just wanted to let you know what an im pactâ€”on a
personal and practical levelâ€”your outstanding research has had for
hundreds of students.â€ I get lots of these letters from coaches and business
leaders, too.
SELF-INSIGHT : WHO HAS ACCURA TE VIEWS OF THEIR ASSETS AND
LIMIT A TIONS?
W ell, m aybe the people with the growth mindset donâ€™ t think theyâ€™re
Einstein or Beethoven, but arenâ€™ t they more likely to have inflated views of
their abilities and try for things theyâ€™re not capable of? In fact, s tudies show
that people are terrible at estimating their abilities. Recently , we set out to
see who  is most likely to do this. Sure, we found that peo ple greatlymisestimated the ir performance  and their ability . But it was those with the
fixed mindset who accounted for almost all the inaccuracy .  The  peo ple with
the growth mindset were amazingly accurate.
When you think about it, this makes sense. If, like those with the growth
mindset, you believe you can develop yourself, then youâ€™re open to accurate
information about your current abilities, even if itâ€™ s unflattering. Whatâ€™ s
more, if youâ€™re oriented toward learning, as they are, you need  accurate
information about your curren t abilities in order to learn ef fectively .
However , if everything is either good news or bad news about your precious
traitsâ€”as it is with fixed-min dset peopleâ€”distortion almost inevitably
enters the picture. Some outcomes are magnified, others are explained
away , and before you know it you donâ€™ t know yourself at all.
Howard Gardner , in his book Extraor dinary Minds,  concluded that
exceptional indi viduals have â€œa special talent for identifying their own
strengths and weaknesses.â€ Itâ€™ s interesting that those with the growth
mindset seem to have that talent.
WHA Tâ€™S IN ST ORE
The other thing exceptional pe ople seem to have is a special talent for
converting lifeâ€™ s setbacks into  future successes. Creativity researchers
concur . In a poll of 143  creativity researchers, there was wide agreem ent
about the number one ingredi ent in creative achievement. And it was
exactly the kind of perseverance and resilience produced by the growth
mindset.
Y ou may be asking again, How can one belief lead to all thisâ€”the love
of ch allenge, belief in effort, r esilience in the face of setbacks, and gr eater
(mor e cr eative!) success?  In the chapters that follow , youâ€™ll see exactly how
this happ ens: ho w the mindsets c hange what people strive for an d what they
see a s success. H ow they change the definition, significance, an d impact of
failure. A nd how  they change th e deepest meaning of ef fort. Y ou â€™ll see how
these mindsets play out in school, in sports, in the workplace, and in
relationships. Y ouâ€™ll see where  they come from and how they can be
changed.Grow Y our Mindset
Which mindset do you have? Answer these questions about
intelligence. Read each statement and decide whether you mostly
agree with it or disagree with it.
1.    Y our intelligence is something very basic about you that you
canâ€™ t change very much.
2.    Y ou can learn new things, but you canâ€™ t really change how
intelligent you are.
3.    No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always
change it quite a bit.
4.    Y ou can always substantially change how intelligent you are.
Questions 1 and 2 are the fixed-mindset questions. Questions 3 and 4
reflect the growth mindset. Wh ich mindset did you agree with  more?
Y ou can be a mixture, but most people lean toward one or the other .
Y ou also have beliefs about ot her abilities. Y ou could substitute
â€œartistic talent,â€ â€œsports ability ,â€ or â€œbusiness skillâ€ for â€œintelligence.â€
T ry it.
Itâ€™ s n ot only you r abilities; itâ€™ s your personal qualities too. Look  at
these statements about personality and character and decide whether
you mostly agree or mostly disagree with each one.
1.    Y ou are a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can
be done to really change that.
2.    No matter what kind of person you are, you can always change
substantially .
3.    Y ou can do things dif ferently , but the important parts of who
you are canâ€™ t really be changed.
4.    Y ou can always change basic things about the kind of person
you are.
Here, questions 1 and 3 are the fixed-mindset questions and
questions 2 and 4 reflect the growth mindset. Which did you  agree
with more?â– 
â– 
â– Did it dif fer from your inte lligence mindset? It can. Y our
â€œintelligence mindsetâ€ comes into play when situations involve mental
ability .
Y our â€œpersonality mindsetâ€ comes into play in situations that
involve your personal qualitiesâ€”for example, how depen dable,
cooperative, caring, or socially skilled you are. The fixed mindset
makes you concerned with how  youâ€™ll be judged; the growth mindset
makes you concerned with improving.
Here are some more ways to think about mindsets:
 
Think about someone you kn ow who is steeped in the fixed
mindset. Think about how theyâ€™re always trying to prove
themselves and how theyâ€™re supersensitive about being wrong or
making mistakes. Did you ever wonder why they were this way?
(Are you this way?) Now you can begin to understand why .
Think about someone you know who is skilled in the growth
mindsetâ€”someone who understands that important qualities can
be c ultivated. Think about the ways they confront obstacles. Th ink
about the things they do to stretch themselves. What are some
ways you might like to change or stretch yourself?
Okay , n ow imagine youâ€™ve decided to learn a new language and
youâ€™ve s igned u p for a class. A few sessions into the course, the
instructor calls you to the front of the room and starts throw ing
questions at you one after another .
Put yourself in a fixed mindset. Y our ability is on the line. Can
you feel everyoneâ€™ s eyes on you? Can you see the instructor â€™ s f ace
evaluating you?  Feel the tension, feel your ego bristle and waver .
What else are you thinking and feeling?
Now pu t yourse lf in a growth mindset. Y ouâ€™re a noviceâ€”thatâ€™ s
why you â€™re here . Y ouâ€™re here to  learn. The teacher is a resource for
learning. Feel the tension leave you; feel your mind open up.
The message is: Y ou can change your mindset.Chapter 2
INSIDE THE MINDSETS
W hen I was a youn g woman, I wa nted a prince-like mate. V ery ha ndsome,
very successful. A big cheese. I wanted a glamorous career , but nothing too
hard or risky . And I wanted it all to come to me as validation of who I was.
It would  be many years before I was satisfied. I got a great guy , but he
was a work in progress. I have a great career , but boy , is it a constant
challenge. Nothing was easy . So why am I satisfied? I changed my mindset.
I c hange d it because of my wo rk. One day my doctoral studen t, Mary
Bandura, and I were trying to understand why some students were so caught
up in proving their ability , while others could just let go and learn. Suddenly
we realized that there were two  meanings to ability , not one: a fixed ability
that needs to be proven, and a changeable ability that can be developed
through learning.
Thatâ€™ s how the m indsets were born. I knew instantly which one  I had. I
realized why Iâ€™d always been so concerned about mistakes and failures.
And I recognized for the first time that I had a choice.
When y ou enter  a mindset, you  enter a new world. In one wo rldâ€”the
world of fixed traitsâ€”success is about proving youâ€™re smart or talented.
V alidating yourself. In the otherâ€”the world of changing qualitiesâ€”itâ€™ s
about stretching yourself to learn something new . Developing yourself.
In one world, failure is about having a setback. Getting a ba d grade.
Losing a  tournament. Getting fired. Getting rejected. It means youâ€™re not
smart or talented. In the other world, failure is about not gr owing. Not
reaching for the things you value. It means youâ€™re not ful filling your
potential.In o ne world, ef fort is a bad thing. It, like failure, means youâ€™re not
smart or talented. If you were, y ou wouldnâ€™ t need ef fort. In the other world,
ef fort is what makes  you smart or talented.
Y ou have a choice. Mindsets are just beliefs. Theyâ€™re powerful beliefs,
but theyâ€™re just something in yo ur mind, and you can change your mind. As
you read, think about where yo uâ€™d like to go and which mindset will take
you there.
IS SUCCESS ABOUT LEARNINGâ€”OR PROVING YOUâ€™RE SMART?
Benjamin Barber , an eminent political theorist, once said, â€œI donâ€™ t divide
the world into the weak and the strong, or the successes and the failures. . . .
I divide the world into the learners and nonlearners. â€
What on  earth would make som eone a nonlearner? Everyone is born
with an intense  drive to learn.  Infants stretch their skills dai ly . Not just
ordinary skills, but the most dif ficult tasks of a lifetime, like learning to
walk and talk. They never decide itâ€™ s too hard or not worth  the ef fort.
Babies d onâ€™ t wo rry about making mistakes or humiliating themselves. They
walk, they fall, they get up. They just bar ge forward.
What co uld put an end to this exuberant learning? The fixed m indset.
As soon  as children become able to evaluate themselves, som e of them
become afraid of challenges. Th ey become afraid of not being smart. I have
studied thousands of people from preschoolers on, and itâ€™ s breathtaking how
many reject an opportunity to learn.
W e of fered four -year -olds a ch oice: They could redo an easy  jigsaw
puzzle o r they could try a harder one. Even at this tender age, children with
the fixed mindsetâ€”the ones wh o believed in fixed traitsâ€”stuck with the
safe one. Kids who are born smart â€œdonâ€™ t do mistakes,â€ they told us.
Children with the growth mindsetâ€”the ones who believed you could
get s marterâ€”thought it was a s trange choice. Why ar e you ask ing me this,
lady? W hy wou ld anyone want to keep doing the same puzzle over and
over?  T hey chose on e hard one after another . â€œIâ€™m dying  to  figure them
out!â€ exclaimed one little girl.
So child ren with the fixed min dset want to make sure they succeed.
Smart p eople should always succeed. But for children with the growthmindset, success is about stretching themselves. Itâ€™ s about becoming
smarter .
One seventh-gra de girl summed it up. â€œI think intelligence is something
you hav e to work for . . . it isnâ€™ t  just given to you. . . . Most kids, if theyâ€™re
not sure of an answer , will not r aise their hand to answer the question. But
what I usually do is raise my hand, because if Iâ€™m wrong, then my mistake
will be correcte d. Or I will raise my hand and say , â€˜How would this be
solved?â€™ or â€˜I donâ€™ t get this. Can you help me?â€™ Just by doi ng that Iâ€™m
increasing my intelligence.â€
Beyond Puzzles
Itâ€™ s one thing to pass up a puz zle. Itâ€™ s another to pass up an opportunity
thatâ€™ s important  to your future . T o see if this would happen, we took
advantage of an unusual situation. At the University of Hong Kong,
everything is in English. Classe s are in English, textbooks are  in English,
and exams are in English. But some students who enter the university are
not fluent in English, so it would make sense for them to do something
about it in a hurry .
As s tudents arrived to register f or their freshman year , we knew  which
ones we re not skilled in English . And we asked them a key que stion: If the
faculty of fered a course for stu dents who need to improve their English
skills, would you take it?
W e also measured their mindset. W e did this by asking them how much
they agreed with statements l ike this: â€œY ou have a certain amount of
intelligence, and  you canâ€™ t reall y do much to change it.â€ People who agree
with this kind of statement lean toward a fixed mindset.
Those w ho lean toward a growth mindset agree that: â€œY ou can always
substantially change how intelligent you are.â€
Later , w e looke d at who said yes to the English course. Students with
the g rowth mindset said an emphatic yes. But those with the fix ed mindset
were not very interested.
Believing that success is abou t learning, students with the growth
mindset seized the chance. But those with the fixed mindset didnâ€™ t want to
expose t heir def iciencies. Instea d, to feel smart in the short run , they were
willing to put their college careers at risk.This is how the fixed mindset makes people into nonlearners.
Brain W aves T ell the Story
Y ou can even see the dif ference in peopleâ€™ s brain waves. People with both
mindsets came into our brain-wa ve lab at Columbia. As they answered hard
questions and got feedback, we were curious about when their brain waves
would show them to be interested and attentive.
People with a fixed mindset were only interested when the feedback
reflected on their ability . Their brain waves showed them paying close
attention when they were told whether their answers were right or wrong.
But when they were presented with information that could help them
learn, there was no sign of interest. Even when theyâ€™d gotten an answer
wrong, they were not interested in learning what the right answer was.
Only pe ople with a growth min dset paid close attention to information
that could stretch their knowledge. Only for them was learning a priority .
Whatâ€™ s Y our Priority?
If you had to choose, which would it be? Loads of success and validation or
lots of challenge?
Itâ€™ s n ot j ust on intellectual tasks that people have to make these choices.
People a lso have  to decide what  kinds of relationships they wan t: ones that
bolster their egos or ones that c hallenge them to grow? Who i s your ideal
mate? W e put this question to young adults, and hereâ€™ s what they told us.
People with the fixed mindset said the ideal mate would:
Put them on a pedestal.
Make them feel perfect.
W orship them.
In o ther words, the perfect ma te would enshrine their fixed q ualities.
My husband says that he used to feel this way , that he wanted to be the god
of a one-person  (his partner â€™ s) religion. Fortunately , he chucked this idea
before he met me.
People with the growth mindset hoped for a dif ferent kind of partner .
They said their ideal mate was someone who would:
See their faults and help them to work on them.Challenge them to become a better person.
Encourage them to learn new things.
Certainly , they didnâ€™ t want people who would pick on them or
undermine their  self-esteem, but they did want people who w ould foster
their dev elopment. They didnâ€™ t assume they were fully evolved, flawless
beings who had nothing more to learn.
Are you already thinking, Uh-oh, what if two people with differ ent
mindsets get together?  A  growth-mindset woman tells  about her marriage
to a fixed-mindset man:
I had barely gotten all the rice out of my hair when I began to realize
I ma de a  big mistake. Every time I said something like â€œWhy donâ€™ t
we try to go out a little more?â€  or â€œIâ€™d like it if you consulted  me
before making decisions,â€ he was devastated. Then instead of
talking a bout th e issue I raised,  Iâ€™d have to spend literally an hour
repairing the damage and making him feel good again. Plus he
would then run to the phone to call his mother , who always
showered him with the constant adoration he seemed to need. W e
were both young and new at marriage. I just wanted to
communicate.
So the husbandâ€™ s idea of a successful relationshipâ€”total, uncritical
acceptanceâ€”was not the wifeâ€™ s. And the wifeâ€™ s idea of a  successful
relationshipâ€”confronting problemsâ€”was not the husbandâ€™ s. One personâ€™ s
growth was the other personâ€™ s nightmare.
CEO Disease
Speaking of reigning from ato p a pedestal and wanting to be seen as
perfect, you wonâ€™ t be surprised that this is often called â€œCEO d isease.â€ Lee
Iacocca had a b ad case of it. After his initial success as head of Chrysler
Motors, Iacocca  looked remarkably like our four -year -olds with the fixed
mindset. He kept bringing out the same car models over and over with only
superficial changes. Unfortunately , they were models no one wanted
anymore.Meanwhile, Jap anese companies were completely rethinking what cars
should look like and how they should run. W e know how this turned out.
The Japanese cars rapidly swept the market.
CEOs f ace this choice all t he time. Should they confront their
shortcomings or  should they cr eate a world where they have  none? Lee
Iacocca chose the latter . He surr ounded himself with worshiper s, exiled the
criticsâ€”and qui ckly lost touch w ith where his field was going. Lee Iacocca
had become a nonlearner .
But not everyon e catches CEO disease. Many great leaders confront
their shortcomin gs on a regular  basis. Darwin Smith, looking back on his
extraordinary performance at K imberly-Clark, declared, â€œI ne ver stopped
trying to be qualified for the job.â€ These men, like the Hong Ko ng students
with the growth mindset, never stopped taking the remedial course.
CEOs fa ce anoth er dilemma. They can choose short-term strategies that
boost the companyâ€™ s stock and make themselves look like hero es. Or they
can work for long-term improvementâ€”risking W all Streetâ€™ s disapproval as
they lay the fou ndation for the health and growth of the company over the
longer haul.
Albert D unlap, a self-professed fixed mindsetter , was brought in to turn
around S unbeam. He chose the short-term strategy of looking li ke a hero to
W all Street. The stock soared but the company fell apart.
Lou Gerstner , an avowed grow th mindsetter , was called in to turn
around IBM. As he set about the enormous task of overhauling IBM culture
and policies, stock prices were  stagnant and W all Street sne ered. They
called h im a failure. A few years later , however , IBM was lead ing its field
again.
Stretching
People i n a growth mindset don â€™ t just seek  cha llenge, they thrive on it. Th e
bigger t he chall enge, the more they stretch. And nowhere can  it be seen
more cle arly tha n in the world of sports. Y ou can just watch people stretch
and grow .
Mia Ham m, the  greatest female soccer star of her time, says it  straight
out. â€œAll my life Iâ€™ve been playing up, meaning Iâ€™ve challenged myself with
players o lder , bi gger , more skillful, more experiencedâ€”in short , better thanme.â€ Fir st she played with her  older brother . Then at ten, she joined the
eleven-year -old boysâ€™ team. Then she threw herself into the number one
college team in the United States. â€œEach day I attempted to play up to their
level . . . and I was improving faster than I ever dreamed possible.â€
Patricia Miranda  was a chubby , unathletic high school kid who  wanted
to w restle. After a bad beating on the mat, she was told, â€œY ou â€™re a joke.â€
First she  cried, then she felt: â€œT hat really set my resolve . . . I had to keep
going and had to know if ef fort and focus and belief and training could
somehow legitimize me as a wrestler .â€ Where did she get this resolve?
Miranda was raised in a life devoid of challenge. But when her mother
died of an aneurysm at age fo rty , ten-year -old Miranda came  up with a
principle. â€œWhen youâ€™re lying on your deathbed, one of the cool things to
say is, â€˜I really explored myself.â€™ This sense of ur gency was instilled when
my mom died. I f you only go through life doing stuf f thatâ€™ s eas y , shame on
you.â€ So when wrestling presented a challenge, she was ready to take it on.
Her ef fo rt paid of f. At twenty-four , Miranda was having the last laugh.
She won  the spot for her weight group on the U.S. Olympic tea m and came
home from Athens with a bron ze medal. And what was next? Y ale Law
School. People ur ged her to stay  where she was already on top, b ut Miranda
felt it was more exciting to start at the bottom again and see what she could
grow into this time.
Stretching Beyond the Possible
Sometimes peop le with the growth mindset stretch themselves  so far that
they do the impossible. In 1995 , Christopher Reeve, the actor , was thrown
from a horse. H is neck was broken, his spinal cord was sever ed from his
brain, an d he was completely p aralyzed below the neck. Medical science
said, So sorry . Come to terms with it.
Reeve, however , started a demanding exercise program that involved
moving all parts of his para lyzed body with the help o f electrical
stimulation. Why couldnâ€™ t  he learn  to move again? Why c ouldnâ€™ t his brain
once aga in give commands that his body would obey? Doctors warned that
he was in denial and was setting himself up for disappointment. They had
seen this before and it was a bad sign for his adjustment. But, really , what
else was Reeve doing with his time? W as there a better project?Five yea rs later , Reeve started to regain movement. First it happened in
his hand s, then his arms, then le gs, and then torso. He was far from cured,
but brain scans showed that his brain was once more sending signals to his
body that the b ody was responding to. Not only did Reeve stretch his
abilities, he changed the entire way science thinks about the nervous system
and its potential  for recovery . In doing so, he opened a whole new vista for
research and a whole new avenue of hope for people with spinal cord
injuries.
Thriving on the Sure Thing
Clearly , people with the growth mindset thrive when theyâ€™re stretching
themselves. Wh en do people with the fixed mindset thrive? W hen things
are safely within their grasp. If  things get too challengingâ€”when theyâ€™re
not feeling smart or talentedâ€”they lose interest.
I wa tched it hap pen as we followed pre-med students through th eir first
semester of chemistry . For many students, this is what their lives have led
up to: becoming a doctor . And t his is the course that decides who gets to be
one. Itâ€™ s one hec k of a hard course, too. The average grade on each exam is
C+, for students whoâ€™ve rarely seen anything less than an A.
Most students started out pretty interested in chemistry . Y et over the
semester , something happened. Students with the fixed mindset stayed
interested only whe n they did well right aw ay .  Those who found it dif ficult
showed a big drop in their interest and enjoyment. If it wasnâ€™ t a testimony
to their intelligence, they couldnâ€™ t enjoy it.
â€œThe ha rder it gets,â€ reported one student, â€œthe more I have to force
myself to read the book and study for the tests. I was ex cited about
chemistry before, but now every time I think about it, I get a bad feeling in
my stomach.â€
In c ontrast, students with the g rowth mindset continued to show the
same high level of interest even when they found the work very
challenging. â€œItâ€™ s a lot more dif ficult for me than I thought it would be, but
itâ€™ s what I want to do, so that only makes me more determined. When they
tell me I canâ€™ t, it really gets me going.â€ Challenge and interest w ent hand in
hand.W e saw the sam e thing in younger students. W e gave fifth graders
intriguing puzzl es, which they all loved. But when we made them harder ,
children with the fixed mindset showed a big plunge in enjoyment. They
also cha nged their minds about taking some home to practice. â€œItâ€™ s okay ,
you can keep th em. I already have them,â€ fibbed one child. In fact, they
couldnâ€™ t run from them fast enough.
This wa s just as true for child ren who were the best puzzle solvers.
Having â€œpuzzle talentâ€ did not prevent the decline.
Children with the growth mindset, on the other hand, couldnâ€™ t tear
themselves awa y from the hard problems. These were their fa vorites and
these we re the ones they wanted  to take home. â€œCould you write down the
name of these p uzzles,â€ one child asked, â€œso my mom can buy me some
more when these ones run out?â€
Not long  ago I w as interested to read about Marina Semyonova, a great
Russian dancer and teacher , who devised a novel way of se lecting her
students. It was a clever test for  mindset. As a former student tells it, â€œHer
students first have to survive a trial period while she watches to see how
you react to praise and to correction. Those more responsive to the
correction are deemed worthy .â€
In o ther words, she separates the ones who get their thrill from  whatâ€™ s
easyâ€”what theyâ€™ve already mas teredâ€”from those who get their thrill from
whatâ€™ s hard.
Iâ€™ll neve r for get  the first time I heard myself say , â€œThis is hard. This is
fun.â€ Thatâ€™ s the moment I knew I was changing mindsets.
When Do Y ou Feel Smart:
When Y ouâ€™re Flawless or When Y ouâ€™re Learning?
The plot is about to thicken, for in the fixed mindset itâ€™ s not enough just to
succeed. Itâ€™ s not enough just to look smart and talented. Y ou  have to be
pretty much flawless. And you have to be flawless right away .
W e asked people, ranging from grade schoolers to young adults, â€œWhen
do you feel smart?â€ The dif ferences were striking. People with the fixed
mindset said:
â€œItâ€™ s when I donâ€™ t make any mistakes.â€
â€œWhen I finish something fast and itâ€™ s perfect.â€â€œWhen something is easy for me, but other people canâ€™ t do it.â€
Itâ€™ s about being perfect right no w . But people with the growth mindset
said:
â€œWhen i tâ€™ s reall y hard, and I try really hard, and I can do som ething I
couldnâ€™ t do before.â€
Or â€œ[Wh en] I work on something a long time and I start to figure it
out.â€
For them itâ€™ s not about imm ediate perfection. Itâ€™ s about learning
something over time: confronting a challenge and making progress.
If Y ou Have Ability ,
Why Should Y ou Need Learning?
Actually , people  with the fixed  mindset expect ability to show  up on its
own, before any learning takes place. After all, if you have it you have it,
and if you donâ€™ t you donâ€™ t. I see this all the time.
Out of all the applicants from all over the world, my department at
Columbia admitted six new graduate students a year . They all had amazing
test scores, nearly perfect grade s, and rave recommendations from eminent
scholars. Moreover , theyâ€™d been courted by the top grad schools.
It to ok one day  for some of them to feel like complete im posters.
Y esterday they were hotshots; today theyâ€™re failures. Hereâ€™ s what happens.
They loo k at the faculty with o ur long list of publications. â€œOh  my God, I
canâ€™ t do  that.â€ They look at the advanced students who are  submitting
articles f or publi cation and writing grant proposals. â€œOh my Go d, I canâ€™ t do
that.â€ Th ey know how to take tests and get A â€™ s but they donâ€™ t k now how to
do this â€”yet. They for get the yet.
Isnâ€™ t that what s chool is for , to teach? Theyâ€™re there to learn ho w to do
these things, not because they already know everything.
I w onde r if this is what happen ed to Janet Cooke and Stephe n Glass.
They we re both young reporters who skyrocketed to the topâ€”on fabricated
articles. Janet Cooke won a Pul itzer Prize for her W ashington Post  articles
about an eight-year -old boy wh o was a drug addict. The boy did not exist,
and she was later stripped of her prize. Stephen Glass was the whiz kid of
The New Republic,  who  se emed to  have stories an d sources reporters only
dream of. The sources did not exist and the stories were not true.Did Jane t Cooke  and Stephen G lass need to be perfect right away? Did
they fe el that admitting igno rance would discredit them with their
colleagues? Did  they feel they should already be like the big-time reporters
before they did the hard work of learning how? â€œW e were starsâ€”precocious
stars,â€ w rote Stephen Glass, â€œand that was what mattered.â€ The public
understands them as cheats, and cheat they did. But I understand them as
talented young peopleâ€”desperate young peopleâ€”who succumbed to the
pressures of the fixed mindset.
There w as a saying in the 196 0s that went: â€œBecoming is bet ter than
being.â€ The fixed mindset does  not allow people the luxury of becoming.
They have to already be.
A T est Score Is Forever
Letâ€™ s take a clo ser look at why , in the fixed mindset, itâ€™ s so crucial to be
perfect right now . Itâ€™ s because one testâ€”or one evaluationâ€”c an measure
you forever .
T wenty years ago, at the age of five, Loretta and her family cam e to the
United S tates. A  few days later , her mother took her to her new school,
where they promptly gave her a test. The next thing she knew , she was in
her kinder garten classâ€” but it was not the Eagles,  the elite kinder garten
class.
As time passed,  however , Loretta was transferred to the Eagles  and she
remained with that group of students until the end of high schoo l, garnering
a bundle of academic prizes along the way . Y et she never felt she belonged.
That first test, s he was convinced, diagnosed her fixed ability and said
that she was not a true Eagle. N ever mind that she had been five years old
and had  just made a radical cha nge to a new country . Or that m aybe there
hadnâ€™ t been room in the Eagles for a while. Or that maybe the school
decided she would have an easier transition in a more low-key class. There
are so many w ays to understand what happened and wha t it meant.
Unfortunately , s he chose the w rong one. For in the world of the fixed
mindset, there is no way to become  an Eagle. If you  were a true Eagle, you
would have aced the test and been hailed as an Eagle at once.
Is Lorett a a rare case, or is this kind of thinking more common than we
realize?T o find out, we showed fifth g raders a closed cardboard box and told
them it had a te st inside. This test, we said, measured an important school
ability . W e told them nothing m ore. Then we asked them questions about
the t est. First, w e wanted to mak e sure that theyâ€™d accepted our description,
so we asked the m: How much do you think this test measures a n important
school ability? All of them had taken our word for it.
Next we  asked: Do you think this test measures how sma rt you ar e ?
And: Do you th ink this test me asures how sma rt youâ€™ ll be when you gr ow
up ?
Students with the growth mindset had taken our word that the test
measured an important ability , but they didnâ€™ t think it measured how smart
they were. And they certainly didnâ€™ t think it would tell them how smart
theyâ€™d be when they grew up. In fact, one of them told us, â€œNo way! Ainâ€™ t
no test can do that.â€
But the students with the fixed mindset didnâ€™ t simply believe  the test
could measure an important abi lity . They also believedâ€”just as stronglyâ€”
that it could measure how smart they were. And  how smart theyâ€™d be when
they grew up.
They gra nted one test the power to measure their most basic inte lligence
now and forever . They gave this  test the power to define them. Thatâ€™ s why
every success is so important.
Another Look at Potential
This lea ds us back to the idea o f â€œpotentialâ€ and to the question  of whether
tests or experts can tell us what our potential is, what weâ€™re capable of,
what our future will be. The fixed mindset says yes. Y ou can simply
measure the fixed ability right now and project it into the future. Just give
the test or ask the expert. No crystal ball needed.
So com mon is the belief that p otential can be known right n ow that
Joseph P . Kennedy felt confident in telling Morton Downey Jr . that he
would be a failure. What had Downeyâ€”later a famous television
personality and authorâ€”done? Why , he had worn red socks and brown
shoes to the Stork Club, a fancy New Y ork nightclub.
â€œMorton,â€ Kenn edy told him, â€œI donâ€™ t know anybody Iâ€™ve ever met in
my life wearing red socks and brown shoes who ever succeeded. Y oungman, let me tell you now , you do stand out, but you donâ€™ t stand out in a way
that people will ever admire you.â€
Many of the most accomplished people of our era were considered by
experts to have no future. Jack son Pollock, Marcel Proust, Elvis Presley ,
Ray Charles, Lucille Ball, and Charles Darwin were all thou ght to have
little po tential for their chosen fields. And in some of these ca ses, it may
well have been true that they did not stand out from the crowd early on.
But isnâ€™ t potenti al someoneâ€™ s capacity to develop  their skills with ef fort
and coaching over time? And th atâ€™ s just the point. How can we know where
ef fort, coaching, and time will take someone? Who knowsâ€”maybe the
experts were right about Jackson, Marcel, Elvis, Ray , Lucille, and Charles
â€”in terms of their skills at the time. Maybe they were not ye t the people
they were to become.
I on ce w ent to an exhibit in Lon don of Paul CÃ©zanneâ€™ s early pa intings.
On my way there, I wondered who CÃ©zanne was and what h is paintings
were like before he was the pain ter we know today . I was intensely curious
because CÃ©zann e is one of my fa vorite artists and the man who set the stage
for muc h of modern art. Hereâ€™ s  what I found: Some of the pai ntings were
pretty bad. They were overwrought scenes, some violent, with amateurishly
painted people. Although there were some paintings that foresh adowed the
later CÃ©zanne, many did not. W as the early CÃ©zanne not talented? Or did it
just take time for CÃ©zanne to become CÃ©zanne?
People with the growth mindset know that it takes time for potential to
flower . Recently , I got an angry letter from a teacher who had taken one of
our surveys. The survey portrays a hypothetical student, Jennifer , who had
gotten 65 percent on a math exam. It then asks teachers to tell us how they
would treat her .
T eachers with the fixed mindset were more than happy to answer our
questions. They felt that by knowing Jennifer â€™ s score, they had a good sense
of w ho she wa s and what she was capable of. Their recom mendations
abounded. Mr . Riordan, by contrast, was fuming. Hereâ€™ s what he wrote.
T o Whom It May Concern:
Having completed the educator â€™ s portion of your recent survey , I
must request that my results be excluded from the study . I feel thatthe study itself is scientifically unsound. . . .
Unfortunately , the test uses a faulty premise, asking teachers to
make assumptions about a given student based on nothing more than
a number on a page. . . . Performance cannot be based on one
assessment. Y ou cannot determine the slope of a line given only one
point, as there is no line to begin with. A single point in time does
not show trends, improvement, lack of ef fort, or mathematical
ability . . . .
 
Sincerely ,                 
Michael D. Riordan
I wa s delighted with Mr . Riord anâ€™ s critique and couldnâ€™ t have agreed
with it more. An assessment at one point in time has little value for
understanding so meoneâ€™ s ability , let alone their potential to succeed in the
future.
It was disturbin g how many te achers thought otherwise, and that was
the point of our study .
The idea  that one evaluation ca n measure you forever is what creates
the ur gency for those with the fixed mindset. Thatâ€™ s why they must succeed
perfectly and immediately . Wh o can af ford the luxury of trying to grow
when everything is on the line right now?
Is there another way to judge p otential? NASA thought so. When they
were so liciting applications for  astronauts, they rejected people with pure
histories of success and instead  selected people who had had  significant
failures and bounced back from them. Jack W elch, the celebra ted CEO of
General Electric , chose executives on the basis of â€œrunway ,â€ th eir capacity
for growth. And remember Marina Semyonova, the famed ballet teacher ,
who cho se the students who w ere ener gized by criticism. They were all
rejecting the idea of fixed ability and selecting instead for mindset.
Proving Y ouâ€™re Special
When people with the fixed mindset opt for success over growth, what are
they r eally  trying to prove? That theyâ€™re special. Even superior .When w e asked  them, â€œWhen do you feel smart?â€ so many of them
talked about times they felt l ike a special person, someone who was
dif ferent from and better than other people.
Until I discover ed the mindsets and how they work, I, too, tho ught of
myself as more talented than others, maybe even more worthy  than others
because of my endowments.  The scariest thought, which I rarely
entertained, was the possibility of being ordinary . This kind of thinking led
me t o need cons tant validation. Every comment, every look was meaningful
â€”it registered on my intelligence scorecard, my attractiveness scorecard,
my likability scorecard. If a day went well, I could bask in my high
numbers.
One bitt er cold winter night, I went to the opera. That night, the opera
was eve rything you hope for , an d everyone stayed until the very endâ€”not
just the end of the opera, but through all the curtain calls. T hen we all
poured i nto the street, and we all wanted taxis. I remember it cl early . It was
after mid night, i t was seven degrees, there was a strong wind, and, as time
went on , I became more and more miserable. There I was,  part of an
undif ferentiated crowd. What ch ance did I have? Suddenly , a taxi pulled up
right next to me . The handle of  the back door lined up perfectly with my
hand, an d as I e ntered, the driver announced, â€œY ou were dif ferent.â€ I lived
for thes e mome nts. Not only was I special. It could be detected from a
distance.
The self -esteem movement encourages this kind of thinking and has
even invented devices to help yo u confirm your superiority . I re cently came
across an ad for  such a product . T wo of my friends send me an illustrated
list e ach year of  the top ten things they didnâ€™ t  get me for Chr istmas. From
January through  November , they clip candidate items from catalogs or
download them from the Internet. In December , they select the winners.
One of my all-time favorites is the pocket toilet, which you fold up and
return to your p ocket after using. This year my favorite was the i love me
mirror , a  mirror  with i love me in huge capital letters written across the
bottom h alf. By looking into it, you can administer the message to yourself
and not wait for the outside world to announce your specialness.
Of cours e, the mirror is harmless enough. The problem is when special
begins to mean better than others.  A more valuable human being. A
superior person. An entitled person.Special, Superior , Entitled
John McEnroe had a fixed mind set: He believed that talent was  all. He did
not love  to learn. He did not thrive on challenges; when the  going got
rough, h e often folded. As a result, by his own admission, he d id not fulfill
his potential.
But his talent w as so great that he was the number one tennis p layer in
the world for four years. Here he tells us what it was like to be number one.
McEnroe used sawdust to absorb  the sweat on his hands during a match.
This time the sawdust was not to his liking, so he went over to the can of
sawdust and knocked it over with his racket. His agent, Gary , came dashing
over to find out what was wrong.
â€œY ou call that s awdust?â€ I said. I was actually screaming at him:
The saw dust wa s ground too fin e! â€œThis looks like rat poison. Canâ€™ t
you get anything  right?â€ So Gary ran out and, twenty minutes l ater ,
came back with a fresh can of coarser sawdust . . . and tw enty
dollars less in his pocket: Heâ€™d had to pay a union employee to grind
up a two-by-four . This is what it was like to be number one.
He goes on to tell us about how  he once threw up all over a d ignified
Japanese lady who was hosting him. The next day she bowed, ap ologized to
him, and  presented him with a gift. â€œThis,â€ McEnroe proclaim s, â€œis also
what it was like to be number one.â€
â€œEverything wa s about you . . .  â€˜Did you get everything you need? Is
everything okay? W eâ€™ll pay you this, weâ€™ll do that, weâ€™ll kiss your behind.â€™
Y ou only have to do what you want; your reaction to anything else is, â€˜Get
the hell out of here.â€™ For a long time I didnâ€™ t mind it a bit. W ould you?â€
So letâ€™ s see. If y ouâ€™re successful, youâ€™re better than other people. Y ou
get t o abuse them and have them grovel. In the fixed mindset, this is what
can pass for self-esteem.
As a contrast, le tâ€™ s look at Michael Jordanâ€”growth-minded ath lete par
excellenceâ€”whose greatness is regularly proclaimed by the world:
â€œSuperman,â€ â€œG od in person,â€ â€œ Jesus in tennis shoes.â€ If anyon e has reason
to th ink of himself as special, itâ€™ s he. But hereâ€™ s what he sai d when his
return to  basketball caused a h uge commotion: â€œI was shocked with the
level of intensity my coming back to the game created. . . . People werepraising me like I was a reli gious cult or something. That was very
embarrassing. Iâ€™m a human being like everyone else.â€
Jordan knew how hard he had w orked to develop his abilities. He was a
person w ho had struggled and grown, not a person who was inherently
better than others.
T om W o lfe, in The Right Stuff,  d escrib es the elite military pilots who
eagerly embrace the fixed mindset. Having passed one rigorous test after
another , they think of themsel ves as special, as people who were born
smarter and braver than other people. But Chuck Y eager , the hero of The
Right Stuff,  begged to dif fer . â€œThere is no such thing as a natural-born pilot.
Whatever my aptitude or talents, becoming a proficient pilot was hard
work, really a lifetimeâ€™ s learning experience. . . . The best pilots fly more
than the  others; thatâ€™ s why theyâ€™re the best.â€ Like Michael Jordan, he was a
human being. He just stretched himself farther than most.
In sh ort, people who believe in fixed traits feel an ur gency to succeed,
and when they d o, they may feel more than pride. They may fee l a sense of
superiority , sinc e success means that their fixed traits are better than other
peopleâ€™ s.
However , lurking behind that self-esteem of the fixed mindset is a
simple question: If youâ€™re somebody  whe n y ouâ€™re su ccessful, what are you
when youâ€™re unsuccessful?
MINDSETS CHANGE THE MEANING OF F AILURE
The Martins worshiped their three-year -old Robert and always bragged
about his feats. There had never been a child as bright and creative as theirs.
Then Robert did something unfor givableâ€”he didnâ€™ t get into the number
one preschool in New Y ork. A fter that, the Martins cooled toward him.
They didnâ€™ t talk about him the same way , and they didnâ€™ t treat him  with the
same pr ide and af fection. He was no longer their brilliant little Robert. He
was someone who had discredit ed himself and shamed them. At the tender
age of three, he was a failure.
As a New Y ork T imes  article points out, failure has been transformed
from an  action (I failed) to an identity (I am a failure). This is especially
true in the fixed mindset.When I was a child, I, too, worr ied about meeting Robertâ€™ s fate. In sixth
grade, I was the best speller in m y school. The principal wanted me to go to
a cit ywide competition, but I refused. In ninth grade, I excelled in French,
and my  teacher wanted me to enter a citywide competitio n. Again, I
refused. Why would I risk turn ing from a success into a failure? From a
winner into a loser?
Ernie E ls, the great golfer , worried about this too. Els finally won a
major to urnament after a five-year dry spell, in which match after match
slipped away from him. What if he had lost this tournament, too? â€œI would
have been a dif ferent person,â€ he tells us. He would have been a loser .
Each April when the skinny e nvelopesâ€”the rejection lettersâ€”arrive
from co lleges, countless failure s are created coast to coast. Thousands of
brilliant young scholars become  â€œThe Girl Who Didnâ€™ t Get into Princetonâ€
or the â€œThe Boy Who Didnâ€™ t Get into Stanford.â€
Def ining Moments
Even in the growth mindset, failure can be a painful experience. But it
doesnâ€™ t define you. Itâ€™ s a problem to be faced, dealt with, and learned from.
Jim Marshall, former defensive player for the Minnesota V ikings,
relates what could easily have m ade him into a failure. In a g ame against
the San Francisco 49ers, Marsh all spotted the football on the ground. He
scooped it up an d ran for a touchdown as the crowd cheered. Bu t he ran the
wrong way . He scored for the wrong team and on national television.
It was the most devastating moment of his life. The shame was
overpowering. But during halftime, he thought, â€œIf you make a mistake, you
got t o m ake it right. I realized I  had a choice. I could sit in my misery or I
could do  someth ing about it.â€ P ulling himself together for the second half,
he p layed some of his best fo otball ever and contributed to his teamâ€™ s
victory .
Nor did  he stop there. He spo ke to groups. He answered let ters that
poured in from people who finally had the courage to admit their own
shameful exper iences. He heightened his concentration dur ing games.
Instead of letting the experience  define him, he took control of i t. He used  it
to become a better player and, he believes, a better person.In th e fixed mindset, however , t he loss of oneâ€™ s self to failure c an be a
permanent, haunting trauma. Bernard Loiseau was one of the top chefs in
the world. Only a handful of restaurants in all of France receive the
supreme rating of three stars fro m the Guide Michelin,  the most respected
restaurant guide  in Europe. His was one of them. Around the pu blication of
the 2003 Guide Michelin,  howeve r , Mr . Loiseau committe d suicide. He had
lost two  points in another guide , going from a nineteen (out of twenty) to a
seventeen in the GaultMillau.  A nd there we re rampant rumors that he
would lo se one of his three stars in the new Guide.  Although he did  not, the
idea of failure had possessed him.
Loiseau had been a pioneer . He was one of the first to adva nce the
â€œnouvelle cuisine,â€ trading the traditional butter and cream sauces of French
cooking for the brighter flavo rs of the foods themselves. A man of
tremendous ene r gy , he was also an entrepreneur . Besides his three-star
restaurant in Bur gundy , he had created three eateries in Paris, numerous
cookbooks, and  a line of frozen foods. â€œIâ€™m like Y ves Saint L aurent,â€ he
told people. â€œI do both haute couture and ready-to-wear .â€
A man of such talent and orig inality could easily have planned for a
satisfying future , with or without the two points or the third star . In fact, the
director of the GaultMillau  said it was unimaginable that their rating could
have tak en his life. But in the f ixed mindset, it is  imaginable. Their lower
rating gave him a new definition of himself: Failure. Has-been.
Itâ€™ s strik ing what counts as failu re in the fixed mindset. So, on a lighter
note . . .
My Success Is Y our Failure
Last summer my husband and I went to a dude ranch, something  very novel
since neither of us had ever mad e contact with a horse. One day , we signed
up for a lesson in fly fishing. It  was taught by a wonderful eighty-year -old
cowboy-type fisherman who showed us how to cast the fishing line, and
then turned us loose.
W e soon  realized that he had not taught us how to recognize when the
trout bit the lure (they donâ€™ t tug on the line; you have to watch for a bubble
in the water), what to do when the trout bit the lure (tug upward), or how to
reel the trout in if by some miracle we got that far (pull the fish along thewater; do not ho ist it into the air). W ell, time passed, the mosqui toes bit, but
not so the trout. None of the do zen or so of us made the slighte st progress.
Suddenly , I hit t he jackpot. Some careless trout bit hard on my lure and the
fisherman, who happened to be right there, talked me through th e rest. I had
me a rainbow trout.
Reaction #1: My husband, David, came running over beaming with
pride and saying, â€œLife with you is so exciting!â€
Reaction #2: That evening when we came into the dining room for
dinner , two men came up to my husband and said, â€œDavid, howâ€™re you
coping?â€ David looked at them blankly; he had no idea what they were
talking about. Of course he didnâ€™ t. He was the one who thought my
catching the fish was exciting. But I knew exactly what they m eant. They
had expe cted him  to feel diminished, and they went on to make  it clear that
thatâ€™ s exactly what my success had done to them.
Shirk, Cheat, Blame: Not a Recipe for Success
Beyond how traumatic a setback can be in the fixed mindset, this mindset
gives you no good recipe for overcoming it. If failure means you lack
competence or potentialâ€”that you ar e  a  failureâ€”whe re do you go from
there?
In one study , seventh graders told us how they would respond to an
academic failure â€”a poor test gr ade in a new course. Those with the growth
mindset, no big surprise, said they would study harder for the n ext test. But
those wi th the fixed mindset said they would study less  for the next test. If
you donâ€™ t have the ability , why waste your time? And, they said, they would
seriously consid er cheating! If y ou donâ€™ t have the ability , they thought, you
just have to look for another way .
Whatâ€™ s more, instead of trying to learn from and repair their failures,
people with the fixed mindset may simply try to repair their self-esteem.
For exam ple, th ey may go looking for people who are even worse of f than
they are.
College students , after doing po orly on a test, were given a ch ance to
look at tests of other students. Those in the growth mindset lo oked at the
tests of people who had done far better than they had. As usual, they wanted
to correc t their deficiency . But s tudents in the fixed mindset cho se to look atthe tests of peo ple who had d one r eally  poorly . That was their way of
feeling better about themselves.
Jim Collins tells in Good to Gr eat  of a sim ilar th ing in the corporate
world. As Procter & Gamble sur ged into the paper goods business, Scott
Paperâ€”which w as then the le aderâ€”just gave up. Instead of mobilizing
themselves and putting up a fight, they said, â€œOh, well . . . at least there are
people in the business worse of f than we are.â€
Another way people with the fixed mindset try to repair th eir self-
esteem a fter a failure is by assig ning blame or making excuses. Letâ€™ s return
to John McEnroe.
It w as never his fault. One time he lost a match because he had  a fever .
One time he ha d a backache. One time he fell victim to expectations,
another time to the tabloids. On e time he lost to a friend becaus e the friend
was in love and he wasnâ€™ t. One time he ate too close to the match. One time
he was too chunky , another time  too thin. One time it was too cold, another
time too hot. One time he was undertrained, another time overtrained.
His mos t agoniz ing loss, and the one that still keeps him up nights, was
his loss in the 19 84 French Open. Why did he lose after leading  Ivan Lendl
two sets to non e? According to McEnroe, it wasnâ€™ t his fault. An NBC
cameraman had taken of f his headset and a noise started coming from the
side of the court.
Not his fault. So  he didnâ€™ t train to improve his ability to concen trate or
his emotional control.
John W o oden, the legendary basketball coach, says you arenâ€™ t a failure
until you start to blame. What  he means is that you can sti ll be in the
process of learning from your mistakes until you deny them.
When Enron, the ener gy giant, failedâ€”toppled by a culture of arrogance
â€”whose fault was it? Not mine, insisted Jef frey Skilling, th e CEO and
resident genius. It was the worldâ€™ s fault. The world did not appr eciate what
Enron was trying to do. What a bout the Justice Departmentâ€™ s investigation
into massive corporate deception? A â€œwitch hunt.â€
Jack W elch, the growth-minded CEO, had a completely dif ferent
reaction to one of General Ele ctricâ€™ s fiascos. In 1986, General Electric
bought Kidder , Peabody , a W all Street investment banking firm. Soon after
the deal closed, Kidder , Peabody was hit with a big insider trading scandal.
A fe w years later , calamity struc k again in the form of Joseph J ett, a traderwho ma de a bunch of fictitious trades, to the tune of hundreds of millions,
to p ump up his bonus. W elch phoned fourteen of his top GE colleagues to
tell them  the bad news and to apologize personally . â€œI blamed  myself for
the disaster ,â€ W elch said.
Mindset and Depression
Maybe Bernard Loiseau, the French chef, was just depressed. W ere you
thinking that?
As a  psychologist and an educat or , I am vitally interested in depression.
It ru ns wild on college campus es, especially in February and March. The
winter is not over , the summe r is not in sight, work has pi led up, and
relationships are often frayed. Y et itâ€™ s been clear to me for a long time that
dif ferent students handle depression in dramatically dif ferent ways. Some
let e verything slide. Others, tho ugh feeling wretched, hang on. They drag
themselves to class, keep up with their work, and take care of themselvesâ€”
so that when they feel better , their lives are intact.
Not long ago, we decided to see whether mindsets play a role  in this
dif ference. T o find out, we measured studentsâ€™ mindsets and the n had them
keep an online â€œ diaryâ€ for three weeks in February and March. Every day
they answered questions about their mood, their activities, an d how they
were coping with problems. Hereâ€™ s what we discovered.
First, the students with the fixed mindset had higher levels of
depression. Our analyses showed that this was because they ruminated over
their problems and setbacks, essentially tormenting themselves with the
idea that the set backs meant they were incompetent or unwor thy: â€œIt just
kept circulating in my head: Y ouâ€™re a dope.â€ â€œI just couldnâ€™ t let go of the
thought that this made me less of a man.â€ Again, failures labeled them and
left them no route to success.
And the  more depressed they felt, the more they let things go;  the less
they too k action to solve their problems. For example, they d idnâ€™ t study
what they needed to, they didnâ€™ t hand in their assignments on time, and they
didnâ€™ t keep up with their chores.
Although students with the fixed mindset showed more depression,
there we re still plenty of people with the growth mindset who felt pretty
miserable, this being peak se ason for depression. And here we sawsomething really amazing. The mor e  d epress ed people with the gr owth
mindset felt (short of severe depression), the mor e  they took action to
confront their problems, the mor e  they made sure to keep up with their
schoolwork, and  the mor e  th ey kept up wi th their lives. Th e worse they felt,
the more determined they became!
In fact, from the  way they acted , it might have been hard to know how
despondent they were. Here is a story a young man told me.
I wa s a freshman and it was th e first time I had been away from
home. Everyone was a stranger , the courses were hard, and as the
year wore on I felt more and more depressed. Eventually , it rea ched
a po int where I could hardly get out of bed in the morning. But
every da y I forced myself to get  up, shower , shave, and do whatever
it was I needed to do. One day I really hit a low point and I decided
to as k fo r help, so I went to the teaching assistant in my psycho logy
course and asked for her advice.
â€œAre you going to your classes?â€ she asked.
â€œY es,â€ I replied.
â€œAre you keeping up with your reading?â€
â€œY es.â€
â€œAre you doing okay on your exams?â€
â€œY es.â€
â€œW ell,â€ she informed me, â€œthen youâ€™re not depressed.â€
Y es, he was depressed, but he w as coping the way people in the growth
mindset tend to copeâ€”with determination.
Doesnâ€™ t temper ament have a lot to do with it? Arenâ€™ t some people
sensitive by nature, while others just let things roll of f their backs?
T emperament certainly plays a role, but mindset is an important part of the
story . When we taught  people the growth mindset, it changed the way they
reacted to their depressed mood . The worse they felt, the more motivated
they became and the more they confronted the problems that faced them.
In short, when people believe in fixed traits, they are always in danger
of b eing measured by a failure. It can define them in a permanent way .
Smart o r talente d as they may be, this mindset seems to rob them of their
coping resources.When p eople believe their basic qualities can be developed, failures
may still hurt, but failures donâ€™ t define them. And if abilities can be
expandedâ€”if change and grow th are possibleâ€”then there are still many
paths to success.
MINDSETS CHANGE THE MEANING OF EFFORT
As children, we were given a choice between the talented but erratic hare
and the plodding but steady tortoise. The lesson was supposed to be that
slow and steady wins the race. But, really , did any of us ever want to be the
tortoise?
No, we just wan ted to be a less foolish hare. W e wanted to be swift as
the wind and a bit more strategicâ€”say , not taking quite so many snoozes
before the finish line. After all , everyone knows you have to show up in
order to win.
The story of the tortoise and the hare, in trying to put forward the power
of ef fort, gave ef fort a bad name. It reinforced the image that ef fort is for
the plodders and suggested tha t in rare instances, when tale nted people
dropped the ball, the plodder could sneak through.
The little engine that could, the saggy , baggy elephant, and the scruf fy
tugboatâ€”they w ere cute, they were often overmatched, and we were happy
for t hem when they succeeded. In fact, to this day I remember  how fond I
was of those little creatures (or machines), but no way did I identify with
them. Th e mess age was: If youâ€™re unfortunate enough to be the runt of the
litterâ€”if you lack endowmentâ€”you donâ€™ t have to be an utter failure. Y ou
can be a sweet, adorable little slogger , and maybe (if you really work at it
and withstand all the scornful onlookers) even a success.
Thank you very much, Iâ€™ll take the endowment.
The problem was that these stories made it into an eitherâ€“or . Either you
have ability or  you expend ef fort. And this is  part of the fixed mindset.
Ef fort is for thos e who donâ€™ t hav e the ability . People with the fixed mindset
tell us, â€œIf you have to work at something, you must not be good at it.â€
They add, â€œThings come easily to people who are true geniuses.â€C A L V I N  A N D  H O B B E S  Â© 1995 W A T T E R S O N .

I wa s a young professor in the psychology department at the Un iversity
of Illino is. Late one night, I was passing the psychology building and
noticed that the lights were on in some faculty of fices. Some of my
colleagues were working late. They must not be as smart as I am,  I thought
to myself.
It ne ver occurred to me that t hey might be just as smart and more
hardworking! Fo r me it was eitherâ€“or . And it was clear I valued the either
over the or .
Malcolm Gladwell, the author and New Y orker  writer , has suggested that
as a  society we value natural, ef fortless accomplishment over a chievement
through ef fort. W e endow our heroes with superhuman abilities that led
them ine vitably toward their greatness. Itâ€™ s as if Midori poppe d out of the
womb fiddling, Michael Jordan dribbling, and Picasso doodling. This
captures the fixed mindset perfectly . And itâ€™ s everywhere.
A report from re searchers at Duke University sounds an alarm about the
anxiety and depression among female under graduates who aspire to
â€œef fortless perfection.â€ They believe they should display perfect beauty ,
perfect w omanhood, and perfec t scholarship all without trying (or at least
without appearing to try).
Americans arenâ€™ t the only people who disdain ef fort. French executive
Pierre C hevalier says, â€œW e are not a nation of ef fort. After all, if you have
savoir -faire [a mixture of know-how and cool], you do things ef fortlessly .â€
People with the growth mindset, however , believe something very
dif ferent. For them, even geniuses have to work hard for their
achievements. And whatâ€™ s so heroic, they would say , about ha ving a gift?
They ma y appreciate endowment, but they admire ef fort, for no matter whatyour ability is, ef fort is what ignites that ability and turns it into
accomplishment.
Seabiscuit
Here was a horse who was so broken, he was supposed to be put to sleep. In
fact, here was a whole team of peopleâ€”the jockey , the owner , the trainerâ€”
who we re damaged in one way or another . Y et through their dogged
determination and against all odds, they transformed themselves into
winners. A down-and-out nation saw this horse and rider as a  symbol of
what could be accomplished through grit and spirit.
Equally moving is the parallel story about Seabiscuit â€™ s author , Laura
Hillenbrand. Felled in her college years by severe, recurrent chronic fatigue
that nev er went away , she was often unable to function. Y et s omething in
the story  of the â€œ horse who couldâ€ gripped and inspired her , so t hat she was
able to write a heartfelt, magnificent story about the triumph of will. The
book was a testament to Seabiscuitâ€™ s triumph and her own, equally .
Seen thr ough th e lens of the growth mindset, these are stories about the
transformative power of ef fortâ€” the power of ef fort to change your ability
and to change you as a person. B ut filtered through the fixed m indset, itâ€™ s a
great sto ry abou t three men and  a horse, all with deficiencies, who had  to
try very hard.
High Ef fort: The Big Risk
From the point of view of the f ixed mindset, ef fort is only for people with
deficiencies. An d when people already know theyâ€™re deficient, maybe they
have nothing to lose by trying. But if your claim to fame is not having any
deficienciesâ€”if youâ€™re considered a genius, a talent, or a natura lâ€”then you
have a lot to lose. Ef fort can r educe  you.
Nadja Salerno-Sonnenber g made her violin debut at the age of ten with
the P hiladelphia  Orchestra. Y et when she arrived at Juilliard to study with
Dorothy DeLay , the great violin teacher , she had a repertoire of awful
habits. Her fingerings and bowings were awkward and she held her violin in
the w rong position, but she refused to change. After several years, she saw
the other  students catching up an d even surpassing her , and by her late teensshe had a crisis of confidence. â€œ I was used to success, to the p rodigy label
in newspapers, and now I felt like a failure.â€
This pro digy was afraid of try ing. â€œEverything I was going through
boiled down to fear . Fear of trying and failing. . . . If you go to  an audition
and don â€™ t really try , if youâ€™re no t really prepared, if you didnâ€™ t work as hard
as you could have and you donâ€™ t win, you have an excuse. . . . Nothing is
harder than saying, â€˜I gave it my all and it wasnâ€™ t good enough.â€™ â€
The idea of tryin g and still failingâ€”of leaving yourself without excuses
â€”is the  worst fear within the f ixed mindset, and it haunted an d paralyzed
her . She had even stopped bringing her violin to her lesson!
Then, on e day , after years of patience and understanding, DeL ay told
her , â€œListen, if you donâ€™ t bring your violin next week, Iâ€™m throwing you out
of m y class.â€ Sa lerno-Sonnenber g thought she was joking, but DeLay rose
from the  couch and calmly informed her , â€œIâ€™m not kidding. If yo u are going
to w aste your ta lent, I donâ€™ t wa nt to be a part of it. This has g one on long
enough.â€
Why is ef fort so terrifying?
There ar e two reasons. One is t hat in the fixed mindset, great geniuses
are not supposed to need it. So just needing it casts a shadow on your
ability . The second is that, as  Nadja suggests, it robs you of all your
excuses. W ithou t ef fort, you can always say , â€œI could have been [fill in the
blank].â€ But once you try , you canâ€™ t say that anymore. Someone once said
to me, â€œI could have been Y o-Y o Ma.â€ If she had really tried  for it, she
wouldnâ€™ t have been able to say that.
Salerno-Sonnenber g was terrified of losing DeLay . She finally decided
that trying and failingâ€”an hon est failureâ€”was better than the course she
had been on, and so she began training with DeLay for an upcoming
competition. For  the first time she went all out, and, by the way , won. Now
she says, â€œThis is something I know for a fact: Y ou have to work hardest for
the things you l ove most. And when itâ€™ s music you love, youâ€™re in for the
fight of your life.â€
Fear of ef fort can happen in rela tionships, too, as it did with Amanda, a
dynamic and attractive young woman.
I ha d a lot of crazy boyfriends. A lot. They ranged from unreliable
to inconsiderate . â€œHow about a nice guy for once?â€ my best fr iendCarla always said. It was like, â€œY ou deserve better .â€
So t hen Carla fi xed me up with  Rob, a guy from her of fice. He
was great, and n ot just on day one. I loved it. It was like, â€œOh , my
God, a guy who actually shows up on time.â€ Then it became serious
and I freaked. I mean, this guy really liked me, but I couldnâ€™ t stop
thinking about how , if he really knew me, he might get turned o f f. I
mean, w hat if I really , really tried and it didnâ€™ t work? I gue ss I
couldnâ€™ t take that risk.
Low Ef fort: The Big Risk
In th e growth m indset, itâ€™ s almost inconceivable to want something badly ,
to think you have a chance to ac hieve it, and then do nothing about it. When
it happens, the I could have been  is heartbreaking, not comforting.
There w ere few American women in the 1930s through 1950s who were
more su ccessful than Clare Boothe Luce. She was a famous  author and
playwright, she was elected to Congress twice, and she was ambassador to
Italy . â€œI donâ€™ t re ally understand the word â€˜success,â€™ â€ she has said. â€œI know
people use it a bout me, but I donâ€™ t understand it.â€ Her pub lic life and
private tragedies kept her from getting back to her greatest love: writing for
the t heater . Sheâ€™d had great suc cess with plays like The W omen,  but it just
wouldnâ€™ t do for a political figure to keep penning tart, sexy comedies.
For her , politics did not provide  the personal creative ef fort she  valued
most, an d looking back she couldnâ€™ t for give herself for not pursuing her
passion for theater . â€œI often thought,â€ she said, â€œthat if I were to write an
autobiography , my title would be The Autobiography of a Failur e. â€
Billie Jean King says itâ€™ s all abo ut what you want to look back and say .
I ag ree with her . Y ou can look back and say , â€œI could have b een . . . ,â€
polishing your unused endowme nts like trophies. Or you can look back and
say , â€œI gave my all for the things I valued.â€ Think about what you want to
look back and say . Then choose your mindset.
T urning Knowledge into Action
Sure, pe ople wit h the fixed mindset have read the books that say: Success is
about being your best self, not about being better than others; failure is anopportunity , not a condemnation; ef fort is the key to success. But they canâ€™ t
put this into prac tice because their basic mindsetâ€”their belief in  fixed traits
â€”is telling them something entirely dif ferent: that success is  about being
more gif ted than  others, that fail ure does  m easure you, an d that ef fort is for
those who canâ€™ t make it on talent.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
At this point, yo u probably have questions. Let me see if I can answer some
of them.
Question: If people believe their qualities ar e fixed, and they have
shown th emselves to be smart o r talented, why do they have to keep
pr oving it? After all, when the prince pr oved his bravery , he and the
princess lived happily ever after . He didnâ€™ t have to go out and slay a
dragon every day . Why donâ€™ t p eople with the fixed mindset pr ove
themselves and then live happily ever after?
Because every day new and lar ger dragons come along and, as things
get hard er , maybe the ability the y proved yesterday is not up to t odayâ€™ s task.
Maybe t hey were smart enough for algebra but not calculus. Maybe they
were a good en ough pitcher for the minor leagues but not the majors.
Maybe t hey wer e a good enoug h writer for their school newspa per but not
The New Y ork T imes.
So t heyâ€™re racing to prove themselves over and over , but where are they
going? T o me theyâ€™re often running in place, amassing countless
af firmations, but not necessarily ending up where they want to be.
Y ou know those movies where the main character wakes up one day and
sees that his life has not been worthwhileâ€”he has always been besting
people, not growing, learning, or caring. My favorite is Gr oundhog Day ,
which I didnâ€™ t s ee for a long time because I couldnâ€™ t get past th e name. At
any rate , in Gr oundhog Day ,  Bill Murray doesnâ€™ t just wake up one day and
get t he message; he has to repe at the same day over and over u ntil he gets
the message.
Phil Con nors (Murray) is a weatherman for a local station in Pi ttsbur gh
who is dispatched to Punxsutawney , Pennsylvania, to cover the GroundhogDay ceremony . On February 2, a groundhog is taken out of his little house;
if he is j udged to have seen his shadow , there will be another s ix weeks of
winter . If not, there will be an early spring.
Phil, con sidering himself to be a  superior being, has complete contempt
for t he ceremony , the town, an d the people (â€œhicksâ€ and â€œmoronsâ€), and
after making that perfectly clear , he plans to get out of Punxsutawney as
quickly as possible. But this is  not to be. A blizzard hits the town, he is
forced to remain, and when he wakes up the next morning, itâ€™ s Groundhog
Day aga in. The same Sonny and  Cher song, â€œI Got Y ou Babe,â€ wakes him
up on the clock radio and the same groundhog festival is gearing up once
again. And again. And again.
At first, he uses the knowledge to further his typical agenda, making
fools out of othe r people. Since he is the only one reliving the day , he can
talk to a woman on one day , and then use the information to deceive,
impress, and seduce her the next. He is in fixed-mindset heaven. He can
prove his superiority over and over .
But after countless such days, he realizes itâ€™ s all going nowhere and he
tries to kill himself. He crashes a car , he electrocutes himself, he jumps
from a steeple, he walks in fro nt of a truck. W ith no way out, it finally
dawns on him. He could be using this time to learn. He goe s for piano
lessons. He reads voraciously . H e learns ice sculpting. He finds out about
people w ho need help that day  (a boy who falls from a tree, a man who
chokes on his s teak) and starts to help them, and care about them. Pretty
soon the day is not long enough! Only when this change of mindset is
complete is he released from the spell.
Question: Ar e mindsets a permanent part of your makeup or can
you change them?
Mindsets are an important part of your personality , but you can  change
them. Just by knowing about the two mindsets, you can start thinking and
reacting in new ways. People tell me they start to catch thems elves when
they are in the throes of the fixed mindsetâ€”passing up a chance for
learning, feelin g labeled by a failure, or getting discouraged when
something requi res a lot of ef fort. And then they switch themselves into the
growth mindsetâ€”making sure they take the challenge, lear n from thefailure, or continue their ef fort. When my graduate students and I first
discovered the mindsets, they w ould catch me in the fixed mindset, smile
kindly , and let me know it.
Itâ€™ s also important to realize that even if people have a fixed mindset,
theyâ€™re not always in that mindset. In fact, in many of our studies, we put
people into a growth mindset. W e tell them that an ability can be learned
and that  the task will give them a chance to do that. Or we have them read a
scientific article that teaches them the growth mindset. The article describes
people who did not have natur al ability , but who developed exceptional
skills. These experiences make our research participants into growth-
minded thinkers , at least for the momentâ€”and they act like growth-minded
thinkers, too.
Later , thereâ€™ s a chapter all abou t change. There I describe people who
have changed and programs weâ€™ve developed to bring about change.
Question: Can I be half-and-h alf? I r ecognize both mindsets in
myself.
All of us have elements of bothâ€”weâ€™re all  a mixt ure of fixed and
growth m indsets. Iâ€™m talking about it as a simple eitherâ€“or right now for the
sake of simplicity .
People can also have dif ferent m indsets in dif ferent areas. I might think
that my artistic skills are fixed but that my intelligence can be developed.
Or t hat m y pers onality is fixed, but my creativity can be develo ped. W eâ€™ve
found that whatever mindset p eople have in a particular area  will guide
them in that area.
Question: W ith all your belief in effort, ar e you saying that when
people fail, itâ€™ s always their faultâ€”they didnâ€™ t try har d enough?
No! Itâ€™ s true that ef fort is crucia lâ€”no one can succeed for long  without
itâ€”but i tâ€™ s certa inly not the only  thing. People have dif ferent resources and
opportunities. For example, people with money (or rich parents) have a
safety net. They can take more risks and keep going longer until they
succeed. People with easy access to a good education, peo ple with a
network of influential friends, people who know how to be in the rightplace at the righ t timeâ€”all stand a better chance of having the ir ef fort pay
of f. Rich, educated, connected ef fort works better .
People with fewer resources, in spite of their best ef forts, can be
derailed so m uch more e asily . The hometown plant youâ€™ve worked in al l of
your life  sudden ly shuts down. What now? Y our child falls ill and plunges
you into  debt. There goes the house. Y our spouse runs of f with the nest egg
and leaves you with the children and bills. For get the night school classes.
Before we judge, letâ€™ s remember that ef fort isnâ€™ t quite everything and
that all ef fort is not created equal.
Question: Y ou keep talking abo ut how the gr owth mindset m akes
people n umber one, the best, th e most successful. Isnâ€™ t the gr owth
mindset about personal development, not besting others?
I u se examples of people who made it to the top to show how far the
growth mindset can take you: Believing talents can be developed allows
people to fulfill their potential.
In additi on, exam ples of laid-back people having a good time would not
be a s convincing to people with a fixed mindset. It doesnâ€™ t provide a
compelling alternative for them because it makes it look lik e a choice
between fun and excellence.
However , this point is crucial: The growth mindset does  allo w p eople to
love what theyâ€™re doingâ€”and to continue to love it in the face of
dif ficulties. The growth-minded athletes, CEOs, musicians, or scientists all
loved what they did, whereas many of the fixed-minded ones did not.
Many gr owth-minded people did nâ€™ t even plan to go to the top. They got
there as a result of doing what they love. Itâ€™ s ironic: The top is where the
fixed-mindset p eople hunger to be, but itâ€™ s where many growth-minded
people arrive as a by-product of their enthusiasm for what they do.
This poi nt is also crucial. In the  fixed mindset, everything is a bout the
outcome. If you failâ€”or if youâ€™re not the bestâ€”itâ€™ s all been w asted. The
growth mindset allows people to value what theyâ€™re doing r egar dless of the
outcome.  Theyâ€™re tackling problems, charting new courses, working on
important issues. Maybe they havenâ€™ t found the cure for cancer , but the
search was deeply meaningful.A lawye r spent seven years fighting the biggest bank in his state on
behalf o f people  who felt theyâ€™d been cheated. After he lost, he said, â€œWho
am I  to say that just because I spent seven years on something I am entitled
to success? Did I do it for the s uccess, or did I do it because I thought the
ef fort itself was valid?
â€œI do not regret it. I had to do it. I would not do it dif ferently .â€
Question: I know a lot of worka holics on the fast track who seem to
have a fixed mindset. Theyâ€™r e always trying to pr ove how smart they
ar e, but  they do work har d and  they do take on challenges. How
does this fit with  your idea that people with a fixed mindset go i n for
low effort and easy tasks?
On the whole, people with a f ixed mindset prefer ef fortless success,
since thatâ€™ s the best way to prove their talent. But youâ€™re righ t, there are
also plen ty of high-powered peo ple who think their traits are fixed and are
looking for constant validation. These may be people whose life goal is to
win a Nobel Prize or become th e richest person on the planetâ€” and theyâ€™re
willing to do w hat it takes. W e â€™ll meet people like this in the chapter on
business and leadership.
These people may be free of the belief that high ef fort equals low
ability , but they have the other parts of the fixed mindset. They may
constantly put their talent on display . They may feel that their talent makes
them superior to other people. And they may be intolerant of mistakes,
criticism, or setbacks.
Incidentally , people with a growth mindset might also like a Nobel Prize
or a lot of money . But they are not seeking it as a validation of their worth
or as something that will make them better than others.
Question: What  if I like my f ixed mindset? If I know what  my
abilities and talents ar e, I know wher e I stand, and I know what to
expect. Why should I give that up?
If you like it, by all means keep  it. This book shows people they have a
choice b y spelli ng out the two  mindsets and the worlds they create. The
point is that people can choose which world they want to inhabit.The fixed mindset creates the feeling that you can r eally  know the
permanent truth about yourself. And this can be comforting: Y ou  donâ€™ t have
to tr y fo r such-a nd-such because  you donâ€™ t have the talent. Y ou will surely
succeed at thus-and-such because you do have the talent.
Itâ€™ s just important to be aware of the drawbacks of this mindset. Y ou
may be robbing yourself of an opportunity by underestimating your talent in
the first area. Or you may be undermining your chances of success in the
second area by assuming that your talent alone will take you there.
By the way , having a growth mindset doesnâ€™ t force you to pursue
something. It just tells you that you can develop your skills. Itâ€™ s still up to
you whether you want to.
Question: Can everything about people be changed, and should
people try to change everything they can?
The gro wth min dset is the belie f that abilities can be cultivated . But it
doesnâ€™ t tell you how much chan ge is possible or how long change will take.
And it doesnâ€™ t mean that everything,  like  preferences or values, can be
changed.
I wa s once in a taxi, and the driver had an opera on the radio. T hinking
to start a conversation, I said, â€œDo you like opera?â€ â€œNo,â€ he  replied, â€œI
hate it. Iâ€™ve always hated it.â€ â€œI donâ€™ t mean to pry ,â€ I said, â€œbut why are you
listening to it?â€ He then told me how his father had been an opera buf f,
listening to his vintage records at every opportunity . My cabdriver , now
well into middle age, had tried for many years to cultivate a rapturous
response to opera. He played th e disks, he read the scoresâ€”all to no avail.
â€œGive y ourself a  break,â€ I advi sed him. â€œThere are plenty of cultured and
intelligent people who canâ€™ t stand opera. Why donâ€™ t you just consider
yourself one of them?â€
The growth mindset also doesnâ€™ t mean everything that can  be changed
should  be cha nged. W e all need to accept some of our imperfections,
especially the ones that donâ€™ t really harm our lives or the lives of others.
The fixed mindset stands in the way of development and change. The
growth mindset is a starting point for change, but people need to decide for
themselves where their ef forts toward change would be most valuable.Question: Ar e people with the fixed mindset simply lacking in
confidence?
No. People with the fixed mindset can have just as much confidence as
people with the growth mindse tâ€”before anything happens, tha t is. But as
you can imagine, their confidence is more fragile since setbacks and even
ef fort can undermine it.
Joseph Martocchio conducted a study of employees who were taking a
short co mputer t raining course. Half of the employees were put  into a fixed
mindset. He told them it was  all a matter of how much ability they
possessed. The other half were put in a growth mindset. He told them that
computer skills could be developed through practice. Everyone, steeped in
these mindsets, then proceeded with the course.
Although the two groups started of f with exactly equal confidence in
their com puter s kills, by the en d of the course they looked quite dif ferent.
Those i n the growth mindset gained considerable confiden ce in their
computer skills as they learned, despite the many mistakes they inevitably
made. But, because of those mis takes, those with the fixed mind set actually
lost  confidence in their computer skills as they learned!
The same thing happened with Berkeley students. Richard Robins and
Jennifer Pals tracked students at the University of California at Berkeley
over the ir years of college. They found that when students had the growth
mindset, they gained confidence  in themselves as they repeate dly met and
mastered the challenges of the university . However , when students had the
fixed mindset, their confidence eroded in the face of those same challenges.
Thatâ€™ s why people with the fixed  mindset have to nurse their confidence
and prot ect it. Thatâ€™ s what John McEnroeâ€™ s excuses were for: to protect his
confidence.
Michelle W ie was a teenage golfer when she decided to go up  against
the big boys. She entered the Sony Open, a PGA tournament that features
the bes t male players in the  world. Coming from a fixed-mindset
perspective, everyone rushed to warn her that she could do serious damage
to h er confidence if she did p oorlyâ€”that â€œtaking too many early lumps
against superior competition could hurt her long-range development.â€ â€œItâ€™ s
always n egative when you donâ€™ t win,â€ warned V ijay Singh, a prominent
golfer on the tour .But W ie  disagreed. She wasnâ€™ t going there to groom her confidence.
â€œOnce y ou win junior tournaments, itâ€™ s easy to win multiple times. What
Iâ€™m doing now is to prepare for the future.â€ Itâ€™ s the learning exp erience she
was afterâ€”wha t it was like to play with the worldâ€™ s best players in the
atmosphere of a tournament.
After th e event, W ieâ€™ s confidence had not suf fered one bit. She had
exactly what she wanted. â€œI thin k I learned that I can play her e.â€ It would
be a long road to the winner â€™ s circle, but she now had a sense of what she
was shooting for .
Some years ago, I got a letter from a world-class competitive swimmer .
Dear Professor Dweck:
Iâ€™ve always had a problem with confidence. My coaches always
told me to believe in myself 100%. They told me not to let any
doubts enter my mind and to think about how Iâ€™m better than
everyone else. I couldnâ€™ t do it because Iâ€™m always so aware of my
defects and the mistakes I make in every meet. T rying to think I was
perfect made it even worse. Then I read your work and how itâ€™ s so
important to focus on learning and improving. It turned me around.
My defects are things I can work on! Now a mistake doesnâ€™ t seem
so important. I wanted to write you this letter for teaching me how
to have confidence. Thank you.
Sincerely ,
Mary W illiams
A re markable thing Iâ€™ve learned  from my research is that in the  growth
mindset, you donâ€™ t always need  confidence.
What I mean is that even when y ou think youâ€™re not good at something,
you can still plunge into it wholeheartedly and stick to it. Actually ,
sometimes you plunge into something because  you â€™re n ot good at it. This is
a wo nderful feature of the growth mindset. Y ou donâ€™ t have to t hink youâ€™re
already great at something to want to do it and to enjoy doing it.
This book is one of the hardest things Iâ€™ve ever done. I read endless
books and articles. The informat ion was overwhelming. Iâ€™d never written inâ– 
â– 
â– 
â– 
â– a po pular way . It was intimidating. Does it seem easy for me? W ay back
when, th atâ€™ s exa ctly what I would have wanted you to think. Now I want
you to know the ef fort it tookâ€”and the joy it brought.
Grow Y our Mindset
People are all born with a love of learning, but the fixed mindset
can undo it. Think of a time you were enjoying somethingâ€”doing
a c rossw ord puzzle, playing a sport, learning a new dance. Then it
became hard and you wanted out. Maybe you suddenly felt tired,
dizzy , b ored, or hungry . Next time this happens, donâ€™ t f ool
yourself. Itâ€™ s the fixed mindset.  Put yourself in a growth mindset.
Picture your brain forming new connections as you meet the
challenge and learn. Keep on going.
Itâ€™ s tempting to create a worl d in which weâ€™re perfect. (Ah, I
remember that feeling from grad e school.) W e can choose partn ers,
make friends, hire people who make us feel faultless. But think
about itâ€” do you  want to never grow? Next time youâ€™re tempted  to
surround yourse lf with worshipers, go to church. In the rest of your
life, seek constructive criticism.
Is there someth ing in your past that you think measured you? A
test scor e? A dishonest or callous action? Being fired from a job?
Being rejected? Focus on that thing. Feel all the emotions that go
with it. Now put  it in a growth-mindset perspective. Look hones tly
at y our role in it, but understand that it doesnâ€™ t define your
intelligence or personality . Inste ad, ask: What did  I (or c an I) learn
fr om tha t exper ience? How can I use it as a basis for gr owth?
Carry that with you instead.
How do  you act when you feel depressed? Do you work harder at
things in  your life or do you let  them go? Next time you feel l ow ,
put yourself in a growth mindsetâ€”think about learning, challenge,
confronting obstacles. Think about ef fort as a positive, constructive
force, not as a big drag. T ry it out.
Is th ere something youâ€™ve alway s wanted to do but were afraid you
werenâ€™ t good at? Make a plan to do it.Chapter 3
THE TRUTH ABOUT ABILITY AND ACCOMPLISHMENT
T ry to  picture Tho mas Edison as vividly as you can. Think about where he
is an d what heâ€™ s doing. Is he al one? I asked people, and they always said
things like this:
â€œHeâ€™ s in his workshop surrounded by equipment. Heâ€™ s working on the
phonograph, trying things. He succeeds! [Is he alone?] Y es, heâ€™ s doing this
stuf f alone because heâ€™ s the only one who knows what heâ€™ s after .â€
â€œHeâ€™ s in New Je rsey . Heâ€™ s standing in a white coat in a lab-type room.
Heâ€™ s leaning over a lightbulb. Suddenly , it works! [Is he alone?] Y es. Heâ€™ s
kind of a reclusive guy who likes to tinker on his own.â€
In truth,  the record shows quite a dif ferent fellow , working in quite a
dif ferent way .
Edison w as not a loner . For the invention of the lightbulb, he h ad thirty
assistants, including well-trained scientists, often working around the clock
in a corporate-funded state-of-the-art laboratory!
It di d no t happen  suddenly . The lightbulb has become the symbol of that
single moment when the brillia nt solution strikes, but there wa s no single
moment of invention. In fact, the lightbulb was not one invention, but a
whole network of time-consuming inventions each requiring one or more
chemists, mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and glassblowers.
Edison w as no naÃ¯ve tinkerer o r unworldly egghead. The â€œW izard of
Menlo Parkâ€ was a savvy entrepreneur , fully aware of the commercial
potential of his inventions. He also knew how to cozy up to the pressâ€”
sometimes beating others out as the  i nve ntor of som ething because he knew
how to publicize himself.Y es, he was a genius. But he w as not always one. His biographer , Paul
Israel, sifting through all the av ailable information, thinks he was more or
less a regular boy of his time and place. Y oung T om was taken with
experiments and mechanical things (perhaps more avidly than  most), but
machines and technology wer e part of the ordinary midwestern boyâ€™ s
experience.
What ev entually set him apart was his mindset and drive. He never
stopped being the curious, tinke ring boy looking for new challe nges. Long
after other young men had taken up their roles in society , he rode the rails
from city to city learning everything he could about telegraphy , and
working his way up the ladd er of telegraphers through nonstop self-
education and invention. And later , much to the disappointm ent of his
wives, his consuming love remained self-improvement and invention, but
only in his field.
There are many myths about ab ility and achievement, especially about
the lone, brilliant person suddenly producing amazing things.
Y et Dar winâ€™ s m asterwork, The Or igin of Species,  t ook years of
teamwork in the field, hundr eds of discussions with colleagues and
mentors, several preliminary dra fts, and half a lifetime of dedication before
it reached fruition.
Mozart l abored for more than te n years until he produced any work that
we a dmire today . Before then, his compositions were not that  original or
interesting. Actually , they were often patched-together chunks taken from
other composers.
This cha pter is about the real ing redients in achievement. Itâ€™ s about why
some pe ople achieve less than expected and why some people achieve
more.
MINDSET AND SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT
Letâ€™ s step down from the celestial realm of Mozart and Darwin and come
back to earth to see how mindse ts create achievement in real life. Itâ€™ s funny ,
but seeing one student blossom under the growth mindset has a greater
impact on me than all the stories about Mozarts and Darw ins. Maybe
because itâ€™ s more about you and meâ€”about whatâ€™ s happened to  us and why
we are where we are now . And about children and their potential.Back on  earth, we measured studentsâ€™ mindsets as they made the
transition to junior high school : Did they believe their intelligence was a
fixed trait or something they could develop? Then we followed them for the
next two years.
The transition to junior high is a time of great challenge fo r many
students. The work gets much harder , the grading policies toug hen up, the
teaching becomes less personali zed. And all this happens while students are
coping with their new adolescent bodies and roles. Grades suf fer , but not
everyoneâ€™ s grades suf fer equally .
No. In our study , only the stude nts with the fixed mindset sho wed the
decline. The students with the g rowth mindset showed an incr ease  in their
grades over the two years.
When th e two groups had enter ed junior high, their past records were
indistinguishable. In the more benign environment of grade school, theyâ€™d
earned the same grades and achievement test scores. Only when they hit the
challenge of junior high did they begin to pull apart.
Hereâ€™ s how students with the fixed mindset explained their poor grades.
Many m aligned their abilities: â€œI am the stupidestâ€ or â€œI suck in math.â€ And
many covered these feelings by blaming someone else: â€œ[The math teacher]
is a fat male slu t . . . and [the English teacher] is a slob with a pink ass.â€
â€œBecause the teacher is on c rack.â€ These interesting analy ses of the
problem hardly provide a road map to future success.
W ith the threat of failure looming, students with the growth mindset
instead mobilize d their resources for learning. They told us that they , too,
sometimes felt overwhelmed, but their response was to dig in and do what it
takes. They were like Geor ge Danzig. Who?
Geor ge Danzig was a graduate student in math at Berkeley . One day , as
usual, he rushed in late to his math class and quickly copied the two
homework problems from the blackboard. When he later went to do them,
he found them very dif ficult, and it took him several days of hard work to
crack them open and solve them. They turned out not to be  homework
problems at all. They were two famous math problems that had never been
solved.
The Low-Ef fort SyndromeOur students with the fixed mi ndset who were facing the hard transition
saw it as a threat. It threatened to unmask their flaws and turn  them from
winners into losers. In fact, in the fixed mindset, adolescence is one big test.
Am I smart or dumb? Am I good-looking or ugly? Am I cool or ner dy? Am I
a winner or a loser?  And in the fixed mindset, a loser is forever .
Itâ€™ s no wonder t hat many adolescents mobilize their resources, not for
learning, but to protect their eg os. And one of the main ways they do this
(aside fr om prov iding vivid portraits of their teachers) is by not trying. This
is when some of the brightest students, just like Nadja Salerno-Sonnenber g,
simply stop working. In fact, students with the fixed mindset tell us that
their ma in goal in schoolâ€”aside from looking smartâ€”is to exert as little
ef fort as possible. They heartily agree with statements like this:
â€œIn scho ol my main goal is to d o things as easily as possible so I donâ€™ t
have to work very hard.â€
This low-ef fort syndrome is ofte n seen as a way that adolescents assert
their ind ependence from adults,  but it is also a way that students with the
fixed mi ndset pr otect themselve s. They view the adults as saying, â€œNow we
will mea sure yo u and see what youâ€™ve got.â€ And they are answering, â€œNo
you wonâ€™ t.â€
John Ho lt, the great educator , says that these are the games al l human
beings play when others are sitti ng in judgment of them. â€œThe worst student
we had, the wo rst I have ever  encountered, was in his life outside the
classroom as mature, intelligent, and interesting a person as anyone at the
school. What went wrong? . . . Somewhere along the line, his intelligence
became disconnected from his schooling.â€
For students with the growth m indset, it doesnâ€™ t make sense to stop
trying. F or them , adolescence is a time of opportunity: a time to learn new
subjects, a time to find out what  they like and what they want to  become in
the future.
Later , Iâ€™ ll describe the project in which we taught junior high students
the grow th mind set. What I want to tell you now is how teaching them this
mindset unleashed their ef fort. One day , we were introducing the growth
mindset to a new group of students. All at once Jimmyâ€”the most hard-core
turned-of f low-ef fort kid in the groupâ€”looked up with tears in his eyes and
said, â€œY ou mean  I donâ€™ t have to be dumb?â€ From that day on, he worked.
He started staying up late to do his homework, which he ne ver used tobother with at a ll. He started ha nding in assignments early so he could get
feedback and revise them. He now believed that working hard was not
something that made you vulnerable, but something that made you smarter .
Finding Y our Brain
A close friend of mine recently handed me something heâ€™d written, a poem-
story that reminded me of Jimmy and his unleashed ef fort. My friendâ€™ s
second-grade tea cher , Mrs. Beer , had had each student draw and cut out a
paper horse. She then lined up all the horses above the blackboard and
delivered her growth-mindset m essage: â€œY our horse is only as fast as your
brain. Every time you learn something, your horse will move ahead.â€
My frien d wasnâ€™ t so sure about the â€œbrainâ€ thing. His father had always
told him, â€œY ou have too much  mouth and too little brains for your own
good.â€ P lus, his horse seemed to  just sit at the starting gate while â€œeveryone
elseâ€™ s br ain joined the learning chase,â€ especially the brains of Hank and
Billy , th e class geniuses, whose horses jumped way ahead of everyone
elseâ€™ s. But my friend kept at it. T o improve his skills, he kept reading the
comics with his mother and he kept adding up the points when he played
gin rummy with his grandmother .
And soon my sleek stallion
bolted forward like Whirlaway ,
and there was no one
who was going to stop him.
Over the weeks and months
he flew forward overtaking
the others one by one.
In the late spring homestretch
Hankâ€™ s and Billyâ€™ s mounts were ahead
by just a few subtraction exercises, and
when the last bell of school rang,
my horse wonâ€”â€œBy a nose!â€
Then I knew I had a brain:
I had the horse to prove it.â€”P A U L  W O R T M A N
Of c ourse, learning shouldnâ€™ t re ally be a race. But this race he lped my
friend discover his brain and connect it up to his schooling.
The College T ransition
Another transition, another crisis. College is when all the students who were
the brains in hig h school are th rown together . Like our graduate students,
yesterday they were king of the hill, but today who are they?
Nowhere is the anxiety of being dethroned more palpable than  in pre-
med classes. In the last chapter , I mentioned our study of tense but hopeful
under graduates taking their first college chemistry course. This is the course
that would give themâ€”or deny themâ€”entrÃ©e to the pre-med curriculum,
and itâ€™ s well known that students will go to almost any lengths to do well in
this course.
At the beginning  of the semeste r , we measured studentsâ€™ mindsets, and
then we followed them throug h the course, watching their grades and
asking a bout their study strategies. Once again we found that the students
with the growth mindset earned better grades in the course. Even when they
did poor ly on a particular test, they bounced back on the next ones. When
students with the fixed mindset did poorly , they often didnâ€™ t make a
comeback.
In this course, e verybody studied. But there are dif ferent ways to study .
Many students study like this: They read the textbook and their class notes.
If the material is really hard, th ey read them again. Or they might try to
memorize everything they can, like a vacuum cleaner . Thatâ€™ s how the
students with the fixed mindset studied. If they did poorly on the test, they
concluded that chemistry was n ot their subject. After all, â€œI did everything
possible, didnâ€™ t I?â€
Far from it. The y would be sho cked to find out what students with the
growth mindset do. Even I find it remarkable.
The students with growth min dset completely took char ge of their
learning and motivation. Instead of plunging into unthinking memorization
of the course m aterial, they said: â€œI looked for themes and underlying
principles across lectures,â€ and â€œI went over mistakes until I was certain Iunderstood them.â€ They were studying to learn, not just to ace the test. And,
actually , this was why they g ot higher gradesâ€”not because they were
smarter or had a better background in science.
Instead of losing their motivation when the course got dry or d if ficult,
they sai d: â€œI maintained my interest in the material.â€ â€œI stayed positive
about ta king chemistry .â€ â€œI kept myself motivated to study .â€ Even if they
thought the textbook was boring  or the instructor was a stif f, they didnâ€™ t let
their motivation evaporate. Th at just made it all the more i mportant to
motivate themselves.
I got an e-mail from one of my under graduate students shortly after I
had taug ht her the growth mindset. Hereâ€™ s how she used to st udy before:
â€œWhen faced with really tough material I tend[ed] to read the material over
and ove r .â€ After learning the growth mindset, she started using better
strategiesâ€”that worked:
Professor Dweck:
When Heidi [the teaching assistant] told me my exam results
today I didnâ€™ t know whether to cry or just sit down. Heidi will tell
you, I looked like I won the lottery (and I feel that way , too)! I canâ€™ t
believe I did SO WELL. I expected to â€œscrapeâ€ by . The
encouragement you have given me will serve me well in life. . . .
I feel that Iâ€™ve earned a noble grade, but I didnâ€™ t earn it alone.
Prof. Dweck, you not only teach [your] theory , you SHOW it. Thank
you for the lesson. It is a valuable one, perhaps the most valuable
Iâ€™ve learned at Columbia. And yeah, Iâ€™ll be doing THA T [using
these strategies] before EVER Y exam!
Thank you very , very much (and you T OO Heidi)!
No longer helpless,
June                        
Because they think in terms of l earning, people with the growth mindset
are clue d in to a ll the dif ferent ways to create learning. Itâ€™ s od d. Our pre-
med stu dents wi th the fixed min dset would do almost anything for a good
gradeâ€”except take char ge of the process to make sure it happens.Created Equal?
Does th is mean  that anyone with the right mindset can do well? Are all
children created equal? Letâ€™ s take the second question first. No, some
children are dif ferent. In her book Gifted Childr en,  Ell en W inner of fers
incredible descriptions of prodigies. These are children who seem to be
born with heightened abilities and obsessive interests, and w ho, through
relentless pursuit of these interests, become amazingly accomplished.
Michael was one of the most precocious. He constantly played  games
involving letters  and numbers, made his parents answer endles s questions
about letters and numbers, and spoke, read, and did math at an unbelievably
early age. Michaelâ€™ s mother reports that at four months old, he said, â€œMom,
Dad, whatâ€™ s for dinner?â€ At ten months, he astounded pe ople in the
supermarket by reading words  from the signs. Everyone assumed his
mother w as doing some kind of ventriloquism thing. His father  reports that
at three , he was not only doing algebra, but discovering and proving
algebraic rules. Each day , when his father got home from work, Michael
would pull him toward math books and say , â€œDad, letâ€™ s go do work.â€
Michael must have started with  a special ability , but, for me, t he most
outstanding feature is his extreme love of learning and challenge. His
parents c ould no t tear him away  from his demanding activities. The same is
true for every pr odigy W inner describes. Most often people beli eve that the
â€œgiftâ€ is  the ability itself. Y et wh at feeds it is that constant, endless curiosity
and challenge seeking.
Is it  ability or mindset? W as it M ozartâ€™ s musical ability or the fact that
he w orked till his hands were deformed? W as it Darwinâ€™ s scien tific ability
or the fact that he collected specimens nonstop from early childhood?
Prodigies or not, we all have int erests that can blossom into abil ities. As
a ch ild, I was fascinated by people, especially adults. I wond ered: What
makes them tick?  In fact, a few years back, one of my cousins reminded me
of an episode that took place when we were five years old. W e  were at my
grandmother â€™ s h ouse, and heâ€™d had a big fight with his mother  over when
he could eat his candy . Later , we were sitting outside on the front steps and
I said to him: â€œ Donâ€™ t be so stupid. Adults like to think theyâ€™r e in char ge.
Just say yes, and then eat your candy when you want to.â€W ere those the w ords of a budding psychologist? All I know is that my
cousin t old me this advice served him well. (Interestingly , h e became a
dentist.)
Can Everyone Do W ell?
Now back to the first question. Is everyone capable of great thin gs with the
right min dset? Could you march into the worst high school in yo ur state and
teach the students college calcu lus? If you could, then one thing would be
clear: W ith the right mindset and the right teaching, people are capable of a
lot more than we think.
Garfield High School was one of the worst schools in Los Ang eles. T o
say that the stu dents were turned of f and the teachers burne d out is an
understatement. But without thinking twice, Jaime Escalante (of Stand and
Deliver  fam e) taught these inner -city Hispanic students college-l evel
calculus. W ith his growth minds et, he asked, â€œ How  can  I teach them?â€ not
â€œ Can  I teach them?â€ and â€œ How  will they learn best?â€ not â€œ Can  they learn?â€
But not only d id he teach them calculus, he (and his co lleague,
Benjamin Jimen ez) took them to the top of the national charts in math. In
1987, only three other public schools in the country had mo re students
taking the Advanced Placement Calculus test. Those three included
Stuyvesant High  School and the  Bronx High School of Scienc e, both elite
math-and-science-oriented schools in New Y ork.
Whatâ€™ s more, most of the Garfield students earned test grades that were
high enough to gain them college credits. In the whole country that year ,
only a few hundred Mexican American students passed the test at this level.
This means thereâ€™ s a lot of intelligence out there being wasted by
underestimating studentsâ€™ potential to develop.
Marva Collins
Most often when kids are behin dâ€”say , when theyâ€™re repeating  a gradeâ€”
theyâ€™re given dumbed-down material on the assumption that  they canâ€™ t
handle more. That idea comes from the fixed mindset: These students are
dim-witted, so they need the same simple things drummed into  them overand ove r . W ell, the results are d epressing. Students repeat the whole grade
without learning any mor e than they knew befor e.
Instead, Marva Collins took inner -city Chicago kids who had failed in
the p ublic schools and treated them like geniuses. Many of them had been
labeled â€œlearning disabled,â€ â€œretarded,â€ or â€œemotionally disturbed.â€
V irtually all of them were apat hetic. No light in the eyes, no hope in the
face.
Collinsâ€™ s second-grade public school class started out with the lowest-
level rea der ther e was. By June , they reached the middle of the fifth-grade
reader , studying Aristotle, Aesop, T olstoy , Shakespeare, Poe, Frost, and
Dickinson along the way .
Later when she started her own  school, Chicago Sun-T imes  columnist
Zay Smith dropped in. He saw four -year -olds writing sentences like â€œSee
the phys icianâ€ a nd â€œAesop wrote fables,â€ and talking about â€œ diphthongsâ€
and â€œdiacritical marks.â€ He observed second graders reciting passages from
Shakespeare, Longfellow , and K ipling. Shortly before, he had visited a rich
suburban high school where man y students had never heard of Shakespeare.
â€œShoot,â€ said one of Collinsâ€™ s students, â€œyou mean those rich high school
kids donâ€™ t know Shakespeare was born in 1564 and died in 1616?â€
Students read huge amounts, ev en over the summer . One stude nt, who
had entered as a â€œretardedâ€ si x-year -old, now four years later had read
twenty-three bo oks over the su mmer , including A T ale of T wo Cities  and
Jane Eyr e.  The  students r ead deeply and thoughtfully . As the three- an d
four -year -olds were reading about Daedalus and Icarus, one four -year -old
exclaimed, â€œMrs. Collins, if we do not learn and work hard, we will take an
Icarian flight to nowhere.â€ Heated discussions of Macbeth  were common.
Alfred Binet believed you could  change the quality of someone â€™ s mind.
Clearly you can. Whether you measure these children by the breadth of
their knowledge  or by their performance on standardized tests, their minds
had been transformed.
Benjamin Bloo m, an eminent educational researcher , stud ied 120
outstanding achievers. They were concert pianists, sculptors, Olympic
swimmers, wor ld-class tennis  players, mathematicians, an d research
neurologists. M ost were not that remarkable as children and didnâ€™ t show
clear talent before their trai ning began in earnest. Even by early
adolescence, you usually couldnâ€™ t predict their future accomplishment fromtheir current ability . Only their continued motivation and commitment,
along with their network of support, took them to the top.
Bloom concludes, â€œAfter forty years of intensive research on school
learning in the United States as well as abroad, my major co nclusion is:
What any person in the world can learn, almost  a ll persons can  learn, if
provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions o f learning.â€
Heâ€™ s not counting the 2 to 3 percent of children who h ave severe
impairments, and heâ€™ s not counting the top 1 to 2 percent of children at the
other extreme that include children like Michael. He is  counting everybody
else.
Ability Levels and T racking
But arenâ€™ t students sorted into dif ferent ability levels for a reason? Havenâ€™ t
their te st scores and past ac hievement shown what their ability is?
Remember , test  scores and measures of achievement tell you where a
student is, but they donâ€™ t tell you where a student could end up.
Falko Rheinber g, a researcher in Germany , studied schoolteachers with
dif ferent mindsets. Some of the teachers had the fixed mindset. They
believed that students entering their class with dif ferent achievement levels
were deeply and permanently dif ferent:
â€œAccording to my experience studentsâ€™ achievement mostly remains
constant in the course of a year .â€
â€œIf I know stude ntsâ€™ intelligenc e I can predict their school career quite
well.â€
â€œAs a teacher I have no influence on studentsâ€™ intellectual ability .â€
Like my sixth-grade teacher , Mrs. W ilson, these teachers preached and
practiced the fixed mindset. In their classrooms, the students who started
the year in the high-ability group ended the year there, and those who
started the year in the low-ability group ended the year there.
But some teachers preached and practiced a growth mindset. They
focused on the idea that all children could develop their skills, and in their
classrooms a weird thing happened. It didnâ€™ t matter whether students started
the year in the high- or the low-ability group. Both groups ended the year
way up high. Itâ€™ s a powerful experience to see these findings. The group
dif ferences had simply disappeared under the guidance of te achers whotaught fo r impro vement, for these teachers had found a way to reach their
â€œlow-abilityâ€ students.
How tea chers pu t a growth mindset into practice is the topic of a later
chapter , but hereâ€™ s a preview of how Marva Collins, the renowned teacher ,
did it. On the first day of class, she approached Freddie, a left-back second
grader , who wanted no part of s chool. â€œCome on, peach,â€ she said to him,
cupping his face in her hands, â€œwe have work to do. Y ou canâ€™ t just sit in a
seat and grow sm art. . . . I promise, you are going to do,  and you are going
to pr oduce.  I am not going to let you fail.â€
Summary
The fix ed min dset limits achievement. It fills peopleâ€™ s minds with
interfering thou ghts, it makes ef fort disagreeable, and it leads to inferior
learning strategies. Whatâ€™ s more, it makes other people into judges instead
of allie s. Whether weâ€™re talking about Darwin or college students,
important achie vements requi re a clear focus, all-out ef f ort, and a
bottomless trunk full of strategies. Plus allies in learning. This is what the
growth mindset gives people, and thatâ€™ s why it helps their abilities grow and
bear fruit.
IS ARTISTIC ABILITY A GIFT?
Despite the widespread belief th at intelligence is born, not mad e, when we
really th ink about it, itâ€™ s not so hard to imagine that people c an develop
their intellectual  abilities. The intellect is so multifaceted. Y ou can develop
verbal skills or mathematical-sc ientific skills or logical thinking skills, and
so o n. B ut when it comes to arti stic ability , it seems more like a God-given
gift. For example, people seem to naturally draw well or poorly .
Even I believed this. While s ome of my friends seemed to draw
beautifully with no ef fort and n o training, my drawing ability w as arrested
in e arly grade school. T ry as I might, my attempts were pr imitive and
disappointing. I was artistic in other ways. I can design, Iâ€™m great with
colors, I have a subtle sense of composition. Plus I have really good eyeâ€“
hand coordination. Why couldnâ€™ t I draw? I must not have the gift.I hav e to admit that it didnâ€™ t bother me all that much. After all, w hen do
you really have  t o draw? I found out one evening as the dinner guest of a
fascinating man . He was an older man, a psychiatrist, who had escaped
from the Holocaust. As a ten-year -old child in Czechoslovakia, he and his
younger brother  came home from  school one day to find their p arents gone.
They had been t aken. Knowing there was an uncle in England, the two boys
walked to London and found him.
A few years later , lying about his age, my host joined the Royal Air
Force and fought for Britain in the war . When he was wounded , he married
his nurs e, went to medical sch ool, and established a thriving practice in
America.
Over the  years,  he developed a  great interest in owls. He thought of
them as embodying characteristics he admired, and he liked to think of
himself as owlish. Besides the many owl statuettes that adorned his house,
he had an owl-related guest book. It turned out that whenever he took a
shine to  someone, he asked them to draw an owl and write something to
him in this book. As he exte nded this book to me and explained its
significance, I felt both honore d and horrified. Mostly horrified. All the
more be cause my creation was not to be buried somewhere in th e middle of
the book, but was to adorn its very last page.
I wonâ€™ t dwell on the intensity of my discomfort or the poor quality of
my a rtwork, although both were  painfully clear . I tell this story as a prelude
to th e astonishment and joy I fel t when I read Drawing on the Right Side of
the Brain.  O n the opposite page are the before-and-after self-portraits of
people w ho took  a short course in drawing from the author , Betty Edwards.
That is, they are the self-portraits drawn by the students when t hey entered
her course and five days later  when they had completed it.
Arenâ€™ t they amazing? At the b eginning, these people didnâ€™ t look as
though they had much artistic ability . Most of their pictures reminded me of
my owl. But only a few days later , everybody could really draw! And
Edwards swears that this is a typical group. It seems impossible.
Edwards agrees that most peopl e view drawing as a magical ability that
only a select few  possess, and t hat only a select few will ever possess. But
this is because people donâ€™ t understand the componentsâ€”the learnable
componentsâ€”of drawing. Actually , she informs us, they are not drawing
skills at all, but seeing  s kil ls. T hey are  the ability to perceive edges, spaces,relationships, lig hts and shadows, and the whole. Drawing requires us to
learn each component skill and then combine them into one pro cess. Some
people simply pick up these skills in the natural course of their lives,
whereas others have to work to l earn them and put them together . But as we
can see from the â€œafterâ€ self-portraits, everyone can do it.Hereâ€™ s what this means: Just bec ause so me people can do something
with litt le or no training, it d oesnâ€™ t mean that others canâ€™ t do it (and
sometimes do it even better) with training.  T his is so imp ortant, becausemany , many people with the fixed mindset think that someoneâ€™ s early
performance tel ls you all you need to know about their talent and their
future.
Jackson Pollock
It w ould have b een a real shame  if people discouraged Jackson Pollock for
that reason. Experts agree that Pollock had little native talent for art, and
when yo u look at his early pro ducts, it showed. They also agree that he
became one of t he greatest American painters of the twentieth century and
that he revolutionized modern art. How did he go from point A to point B?
T wyla Tharp, the world-famous choreographer and dancer , wrote a book
called The Cr eative Habit.  A s you can gue ss from the title , she ar gues that
creativity is not a magical act of inspiration. Itâ€™ s the result of ha rd work and
dedication. Even for Mozart.  Remember the movie Amadeus ? Remember
how it showed Mozart easily churning out one masterpiece after another
while Sa lieri, his rival, is dying of envy? W ell, Tharp worked on  that movie
and she says: Hogwash! Nonsense! â€œThere are no â€˜naturalâ€™ geniuses.â€
Dedication is how Jackson Pollo ck got from point A to point B.  Pollock
was wildly in love with the idea of being an artist. He thought about art all
the time, and he did it all the time. Because he was so gung ho, he got
others to take him seriously and  mentor him until he mastered all there was
to m aster and b egan to produce startlingly original works. His â€œpouredâ€
paintings, each completely unique, allowed him to draw from his
unconscious mind and convey a huge range of feeling. Several years ago, I
was priv ileged to see a show of these paintings at the Museum  of Modern
Art in New Y ork. I was stunned by the power and beauty of each work.
Can anyone do anything ? I donâ€™ t really k now . However , I think we can
now agree that people can do a lot more than first meets the eye.
THE DANGER OF PRAISE AND POSITIVE LABELS
If pe ople have s uch potential to achieve, how can they gain faith in their
potential? How can we give them the confidence they need to go for it?
How about praising their ability in order to convey that they have what it
takes? In fact, m ore than 80 pe rcent of parents told us it was necessary topraise c hildrenâ€™ s ability so as t o foster their confidence and achievement.
Y ou know , it makes a lot of sense.
But then we began to worry . W e thought about how people with the
fixed mi ndset al ready focus too much on their ability: â€œIs it hig h enough?â€
â€œW ill it look go od?â€ W ouldnâ€™ t praising peopleâ€™ s ability focus them on it
even more? W ouldnâ€™ t it be tellin g them that thatâ€™ s what we value and, even
worse, that we can read th eir deep, underlying ability from their
performance? Isnâ€™ t that teaching them the fixed mindset?
Adam Guettel has been called t he crown prince and savior of musical
theater . He is th e grandson of Richard Rodgers, the man who wrote the
music to  such classics as Oklahoma!  and Car ousel.  Gue ttelâ€™ s mother gushes
about her sonâ€™ s genius. So does everyone else. â€œThe talent is there and itâ€™ s
major ,â€ raved a review in The New  Y ork T imes.  The  question is  whether this
kind of praise encourages people.
Whatâ€™ s g reat abo ut research is th at you can ask these kinds of q uestions
and then  go get the answers. S o we conducted studies with h undreds of
students, mostly  early adolescents. W e first gave each student a set of ten
fairly dif ficult problems from a  nonverbal IQ test. They mostly did pretty
well on these, and when they finished we praised them.
W e p raised some of the students for their ability . They were told : â€œW ow ,
you got [say] eight right. Thatâ€™ s a really good score. Y ou must be smart at
this.â€ They were in the Adam Guettel youâ€™r e-so-talented  position.
W e praised other students for t heir ef fort: â€œW ow , you got [say] eight
right. Th atâ€™ s a really good score. Y ou must have worked really hard.â€ They
were no t made to feel that they had some special gift; they were  praised for
doing what it takes to succeed.
Both groups were exactly equal to begin with. But right after the praise,
they began to dif fer . As we feared, the ability praise pushed students right
into the fixed mindset, and they  showed all the signs of it, too : When we
gave the m a choice, they rejected a challenging new task that they could
learn fro m. The y didnâ€™ t want to  do anything that could expose  their flaws
and call into question their talent.
When Guettel was thirteen, he was all set to star in a Metropolitan
Opera b roadcast and TV movie of Amahl and the Night V isitors.  He bowed
out, saying that his voice had broken. â€œI kind of faked that my  voice was
changing. . . . I didnâ€™ t want to handle the pressure.â€In c ontrast, when students were praised for ef fort, 90 percent of them
wanted the challenging new task that they could learn from.
Then we gave students some ha rd new problems, which they d idnâ€™ t do
so w ell on. The ability kids now thought they were not smart after all. If
success had meant they were in telligent, then less-than-success meant they
were deficient.
Guettel echoes this. â€œIn my fami ly , to be good is to fail. T o be very  good
is to fail. . . . The only thing not  a failure is to be great.â€
The ef fort kids simply thought the dif ficulty meant â€œApply more ef fort
or try new strate gies.â€ They didnâ€™ t see it as a failure, and they didnâ€™ t think it
reflected on their intellect.
What about the studentsâ€™ enjoyment of the problems? After the success,
everyone loved the problems, but after the dif ficult problems, the ability
students said it wasnâ€™ t fun anymore. It canâ€™ t be fun when yo ur claim to
fame, your special talent, is in jeopardy .
Hereâ€™ s A dam G uettel: â€œI wish I could just have fun and relax and not
have the responsibility of that potential to be some kind of gr eat man. â€ As
with the kids in our study , the burden of talent was killing his enjoyment.
The ef fo rt-praised students still loved the problems, and many of them
said that the hard problems were the most fun.
W e then looked at the studentsâ€™ performance. After the experience with
dif ficulty , the performance of the ability-praised students plummeted, even
when we gave th em some more of the easier problems. Losing faith in their
ability , they were doing worse than when they started. The ef fort kids
showed better and better performance. They had used the hard problems to
sharpen their skills, so that when they returned to the easier one s, they were
way ahead.
Since this was a kind of IQ test, you might say that praising ability
lowered the studentsâ€™ IQs. And that praising their ef fort raised them.
Guettel w as not thriving. He was riddled with obsessive-compulsive tics
and bitten, bleeding fingers. â€œSpend a minute with himâ€”it takes only oneâ€”
and a picture o f the terror behind the tics starts to emer ge,â€ says an
interviewer . Guettel has also fought serious, recurrent drug problems.
Rather t han emp owering him, the â€œgiftâ€ has filled him with fear and doubt.
Rather th an fulfi lling his talent, this brilliant composer has spent  most of his
life running from it.One thing is hopefulâ€”his recognition that he has his own life course to
follow that is not dictated by other people and their view of his talent. One
night he had a dream about his grandfather . â€œI was walking him to an
elevator . I asked him if I was a ny good. He said, rather kindly , â€˜Y ou have
your own voice.â€™ â€
Is th at v oice fina lly emer ging? For the score of The Light in the Piazza,
an in tensely romantic musical, Guettel won the 2005 T ony A w ard. W ill he
take it as praise for talent or praise for ef fort? I hope itâ€™ s the latter .
There was one more finding in our study that was striking and
depressing at the same time. W e said to each student: â€œY ou k now , weâ€™re
going to go to other schools, and I bet the kids in those schools  would like
to know about th e problems.â€ So we gave students a page to write out their
thoughts, but we also left a space for them to write the scor es they had
received on the problems.
W ould you believe that almost 40 percent of the ability-praised students
lied  abo ut th eir scor es? And always in one direction. In the fixed mindset,
imperfections are shamefulâ€”especially if youâ€™re talentedâ€”so they lied
them away .
Whatâ€™ s so alarming is that we took ordinary children and made them
into liars, simply by telling them they were smart.
Right af ter I wrote these paragra phs, I met with a young man who tutors
students for their College Boar d exams. He had come to consult with me
about on e of his students. This student takes practice tests and then lies to
him about her sc ore. He is supp osed to tutor her on what she doesnâ€™ t know ,
but she canâ€™ t tell him the truth about what she doesnâ€™ t know! And she is
paying money for this.
So telling children theyâ€™re smart, in the end, made them feel dumber
and act dumber , but claim they were smarter . I donâ€™ t think this is what
weâ€™re aiming for when we put positive labelsâ€”â€œgifted,â€ â€œtalented,â€
â€œbrilliantâ€â€”on people. W e donâ€™ t mean to rob them of their zest for
challenge and their recipes for success. But thatâ€™ s the danger .
Here is a letter from a man whoâ€™d read some of my work:
Dear Dr . Dweck,It was painful to read your chapter . . . as I recognized myself
therein.
As a child I was a member of The Gifted Child Society and
continually praised for my intelligence. Now , after a lifetime of not
living up to my potential (Iâ€™m 49), Iâ€™m learning to apply myself to a
task. And also to see failure not as a sign of stupidity but as lack of
experience and skill. Y our chapter helped see myself in a new light.
Seth Abrams
This is the danger of positive l abels. There are alternatives, and I will
return to them later in the chapter on parents, teachers, and coaches.
NEGA TIVE LABELS AND HOW THEY WORK
I w as once a m ath whiz. In hi gh school, I got a 99 in algebra, a 99 in
geometry , and a 99 in trigonome try , and I was on the math team.  I scored up
there with the b oys on the air force test of visual-spatial abili ty , which is
why I got recruiting brochures from the air force for many years to come.
Then I got a Mr . Hellman, a teacher who didnâ€™ t believe girls c ould do
math. My grades declined, and I never took math again.
I act ually agreed with Mr . Hellman, but I didnâ€™ t think it applied to me.
Other  girls couldnâ€™ t do math. Mr . Hellman thought it applied to me, too,
and I succumbed.
Everyone knows negative labels are bad, so youâ€™d think this would be a
short section. But it isnâ€™ t a short section, because psychologists are learning
how  negative labels harm achievement.
No one knows a bout negative ability labels like members of stereotyped
groups. For example, African A mericans know about being stereotyped as
lower in intelligence. And women know about being stereotyped as bad at
math and science. But Iâ€™m not sure even they know how c reepy these
stereotypes are.
Research by Claude Steele a nd Joshua Aronson shows that even
checking a box to indicate your race or sex can trigger the stereotype in
your mind and lower your test score. Almost anything that reminds you that
youâ€™re black or f emale before taking a test in the subject youâ€™re supposed tobe bad at will lower your test scoreâ€”a lot. In many of their studies, blacks
are equal to whites in their performance, and females are equal to males,
when no stereotype is evoked. But just put more males in the room with a
female before a math test, and down goes the femaleâ€™ s score.
This is why . When stereotypes are evoked, they fill peopleâ€™ s minds with
distracting thoug htsâ€”with secret worries about confirming the stereotype.
People usually arenâ€™ t even aware of it, but they donâ€™ t have enough mental
power left to do their best on the test.
This doesnâ€™ t happen to everybody , however . It mainly happens to people
who are  in a fix ed mindset. Itâ€™ s when people are thinking in ter ms of fixed
traits tha t the stereotypes get to them. Negative stereotypes say : â€œY ou and
your gro up are permanently inferior .â€ Only people in the fixed mindset
resonate to this message.
So i n the  fixed mindset, both positive and negative labels can m ess with
your mi nd. Whe n youâ€™re given a positive label, youâ€™re afraid of losing it,
and when youâ€™re hit with a negative label, youâ€™re afraid of deserving it.
When people are in a growth mindset, the stereotype doesnâ€™ t disrupt
their performanc e. The growth m indset takes the teeth out of the stereotype
and mak es peop le better able to fight back. They donâ€™ t believe in permanent
inferiority . And if they ar e  b ehindâ€”well, then theyâ€™ll work harder , seek
help, and try to catch up.
The gro wth min dset also makes people able to take what they can and
what they need even from a threatening environment. W e asked African
American studen ts to write an essay for a competition. They were told that
when they finished, their essays would be evaluated by Edward Caldwell
III, a distinguished professor with an Ivy League pedigree.  That is, a
representative of the white establishment.
Edward Caldwell IIIâ€™ s feedback was quite critical, but also helpfulâ€”and
studentsâ€™ reactio ns varied greatly . Those with a fixed mindset viewed it as a
threat, an insult, or an attack. They rejected Caldwell and his feedback.
Hereâ€™ s w hat one  student with the  fixed mindset thought: â€œHeâ€™ s mean, he
doesnâ€™ t grade right, or heâ€™ s obviously biased. He doesnâ€™ t like me.â€
Said another: â€œHe is a pompous asshole. . . . It appears that he was
searching for anything to discredit the work.â€
And another , deflecting the feedback with blame: â€œHe doesnâ€™ t
understand the conciseness of m y points. He thought it was vague becausehe was impatient when he read it. He dislikes creativity .â€
None of them will learn anything from Edward Caldwellâ€™ s feedback.
The stud ents wi th the growth m indset may also have viewed h im as a
dinosaur , but he was a dinosaur who could teach them something.
â€œBefore the evaluation, he came  across as arrogant and overdemanding.
[After th e evalua tion?] â€˜Fair â€™ seems to be the first word that comes to mind.
. . . It seems like a new challenge.â€
â€œHe sounded like an arrogant, intimidating, and condescending man.
[What a re you r feelings about the evaluation?] The evaluation was
seemingly honest and specific.  In this sense, the evaluation could be a
stimulus . . . to produce better work.â€
â€œHe see ms to be proud to the point of arrogance. [The evaluation?] He
was inte nsely cr itical. . . . His comments were helpful and clear , however . I
feel I will learn much from him.â€
The growth mindset allowed African American students to recruit
Edward Caldwe ll III for their own goals. They were in college to get an
education and, pompous asshole or not, they were going to get it.
Do I Belong Here?
Aside fr om hijacking peopleâ€™ s abilities, stereotypes also do damage by
making people feel they donâ€™ t belong. Many minorities drop ou t of college
and man y women drop out of math and science because they ju st donâ€™ t feel
they fit in.
T o find out how  this happens, w e followed college women through their
calculus course. This is often when students decide whether math, or
careers i nvolving math, are right for them. Over the semester , we asked the
women to report their feelings about math and their sense of b elonging in
math. Fo r example, when they thought about math, did they feel like a full-
fledged member of the math community or did they feel like an outsider;
did they feel com fortable or did they feel anxious; did they feel good or bad
about their math skills?
The women with the growth m indsetâ€”those who thought math ability
could be improvedâ€”felt a fairly strong and stable sense of belonging. And
they were able t o maintain this even when they thought there was a lot of
negative stereotyping going around. One student described it this way: â€œIn amath class, [female] students were told they were wrong when  they were
not (they were in fact doing things in novel ways). It was absurd, and
reflected poorly  on the instructor not to â€˜seeâ€™ the studentsâ€™ good reasoning.
It w as al right because we were working in groups and we were able to give
& receive support among us students. . . . W e discussed our interesting
ideas among ourselves.â€
The stereotyping was disturbing to them (as it should be), but they could
still feel  comfortable with themselves and confident about themselves in a
math setting. They could fight back.
But women with the fixed mindset, as the semester wore on, felt a
shrinking sense  of belonging. And the more they felt the presence of
stereotyping in their class, the more their comfort with math withered. One
student said that her sense of belonging fell because â€œI was disrespected by
the p rofessor with his comment , â€˜that was a good guess,â€™ whenever I made
a correct answer in class.â€
The ster eotype o f low ability w as able to invade themâ€”to define them
â€”and take away their comfort and confidence. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™ s their fault
by any means. Prejudice is a deeply ingrained societal problem, and I do not
want to blame t he victims of it.  I am simply saying that a growth mindset
helps people to see prejudice for what it isâ€” someone elseâ€™ s  view  of  themâ€”
and to confront it with their confidence and abilities intact.
T rusting Peopleâ€™ s Opinions
Many females have a problem not only with stereotypes, but  with other
peopleâ€™ s opinions of them in general. They trust them too much.
One day , I wen t into a drugstore in Hawaii to buy dental fl oss and
deodorant, and, after fetching m y items, I went to wait in line. There were
two wom en together in front of me waiting to pay . Since I am an incurable
time stuf fer , at s ome point I dec ided to get my money ready for when my
turn came. So I walked up, put the items way on the side of the counter , and
started t o gather  up the bills that were strewn throughout my purse. The two
women went berserk. I explaine d that in no way was I trying to cut in front
of th em. I was just preparing for when my turn came. I though t the matter
was reso lved, but when I left the store, they were waiting for m e. They got
in my face and yelled, â€œY ouâ€™r e a bad-manner ed person!â€My husband, who had seen the whole thing from beginning to end,
thought they were nuts. But they  had a strange and disturbing ef fect on me,
and I had a hard time shaking of f their verdict.
This vulnerability af flicts many of the most able, high-achieving
females. Why should this be? When theyâ€™re little, these girls are often so
perfect, and they delight in everyoneâ€™ s telling them so. Theyâ€™re so well
behaved, theyâ€™re so cute, theyâ€™re so helpful, and theyâ€™re so precocious. Girls
learn to trust peopleâ€™ s estimates of them. â€œGee, everyoneâ€™ s so ni ce to me; if
they criticize me, it must be tru e.â€ Even females at the top universities in
the coun try say that other peopl eâ€™ s opinions are a good way to know their
abilities.
Boys are  constantly being scolded and punished. When we observed in
grade school classrooms, we saw that boys got eight  ti mes more criticism
than gir ls for their conduct. Boys are also constantly calling  each other
slobs and morons. The evaluations lose a lot of their power .
A male friend once called me a slob. He was over to dinner at m y house
and, while we were eating, I dripped some food on my blouse. â€œThatâ€™ s
because youâ€™re such a slob,â€ he said. I was shocked. It was then that I
realized no one had ever said anything like that to me. Males sa y it to each
other all  the time. It may not b e a kind thing to say , even in  jest, but it
certainly makes  them think twice before buying into other peopleâ€™ s
evaluations.
Even when women reach the pinnacle of success, other peopleâ€™ s
attitudes can get them. Frances Conley is one of the most eminent
neurosur geons in the world. In fact, she was the first woman ever given
tenure in neurosur gery at an American medical school. Y et careless
comments from male colleaguesâ€”even assistantsâ€”could fill her with self-
doubt. One day during sur gery , a man condescendingly called her â€œhoney .â€
Instead of returning the compli ment, she questioned herself. â€œIs a honey ,â€
she won dered, â€œ especially this  hon ey , good enough and talent ed enough to
be doing this operation?â€
The fixed mindset, plus stere otyping, plus womenâ€™ s trust in other
peopleâ€™ s assessments of them: All of these contribute to the gender gap in
math and science.
That gap is painfully evident in the world of high tech. Julie L ynch, a
budding techie, was already writing computer code when she was in juniorhigh school. Her father and tw o brothers worked in technology , and she
loved it,  too. Then her comput er programming teacher criticized her . She
had written a computer program and the program ran just fine, but he didnâ€™ t
like a shortcut she had taken. H er interest evaporated. Instead, she went on
to study recreation and public relations.
Math and science need to be m ade more hospitable places for women.
And wo men need all the growth mindset they can get to take their rightful
places in these fields.
When Things Go Right
But letâ€™ s look at the times the process goes right.
The Pol gar family has produced three of the most successful female
chess players ever . How? Says Susan, one of the three, â€œMy father believes
that innate talent is nothing, tha t [success] is 99 percent hard work. I agree
with him.â€ The y oungest daught er , Judit, is now considered the best woman
chess player of all time. She was not the one with the most talent. Susan
reports, â€œJudit was a slow starter , but very hardworking.â€
A colleague of mine has two daughters who are math whizzes. One is a
graduate student in math at a top university . The other was the first girl to
rank num ber one in the countr y on an elite math test, won a  nationwide
math co ntest, an d is now a neuroscience major at a top university . Whatâ€™ s
their secret? Is it passed down in the genes? I believe itâ€™ s passed down in
the mindset. Itâ€™ s the most growth-mindset family Iâ€™ve ever seen.
In fact, their fat her applied the growth mindset to everything.  Iâ€™ll never
for get a conversation we had some years ago. I was single at the time, and
he a sked me wh at my plan was for finding a partner . He was aghast when I
said I didnâ€™ t hav e a plan. â€œY ou wouldnâ€™ t expect your work  to get done by
itself,â€ h e said. â€œWhy is this an y dif ferent?â€ It was inconceivable to him
that you could have a goal and not take steps to make it happen.
In short,  the growth mindset lets peopleâ€”even those who are tar gets of
negative labelsâ€” use and develop their minds fully . Their heads are not
filled wi th limit ing thoughts, a f ragile sense of belonging, and a belief that
other people can define them.â–

Think a bout your hero. Do you think of this person as someo ne
with extraordinary abilities who achieved with little ef fort? Now
go f ind out the truth. Find out th e tremendous ef fort that went i nto
their accomplishmentâ€”and admire them mor e.
Think of times other people outdid you and you just assumed they
were smarter or more talented. Now consider the idea that they j ust
used be tter strategies, taught themselves more, practiced hard er ,
and worked their way through obstacles. Y ou can do that, too, if
you want to.
Are there situations where you get stupidâ€”where you disengage
your intelligence? Next time youâ€™re in one of those situations, get
yourself into a growth mindsetâ€”think about learning a nd
improvement, not judgmentâ€”and hook it back up.
Do you label yo ur kids? This one is the artist and that one is the
scientist.  Next time, remember that youâ€™re not helping themâ€”even
though you may be praising t hem. Remember our study where
praising kidsâ€™ ability lowered their IQ scores. Find a growth-
mindset way to compliment them.
More than half of our society b elongs to a negatively stereotyped
group. F irst you  have all the women, and then you have all the
other groups who are not supp osed to be good at something or
other . G ive them the gift of  the growth mindset. Create an
environment that teaches the growth mindset to the adults a nd
children in your life, especia lly the ones who are tar gets of
negative stereotypes. Even when the negative label comes along,
theyâ€™ll remain in char ge of their learning.Chapter 4
SPORTS: THE MINDSET OF A CHAMPION
I n sports, everybody believes in talent. Evenâ€”or especiallyâ€”the experts.
In fa ct, sports is  where the idea  of â€œa naturalâ€ comes fromâ€”so meone who
looks like an athlete, moves lik e an athlete, and is an athlete, all without
trying. S o great is the belief in natural talent that many scouts a nd coaches
search only for naturals, and teams will vie with each other to pay
exorbitant amounts to recruit them.
Billy Beane was a natural. Everyone agreed he was the next Babe Ruth.
But Billy Beane lacked one thing. The mindset of a champion.
As M ichael Lewis tells us in Moneyball,  by the time B eane was a
sophomore in high school, he was the highest scorer on the basketball team,
the quar terback of the football team, and the best hitter on t he baseball
team, ba tting .500 in one of the toughest leagues in the country . His talent
was real enough.
But the minute things went wrong, Beane searched for something to
break. â€œIt wasnâ€™ t merely that he didnâ€™ t like to fail; it was as if he didnâ€™ t
know how to fail.â€
As h e moved u p in baseball f rom the minor leagues to the majors,
things got worse and worse. Each at-bat became a nightmare, another
opportunity for humiliation, and with every botched at-bat, he went to
pieces. A s one scout said, â€œBilly was of the opinion that he should never
make an out.â€ Sound familiar?
Did Beane try to fix his problems in constructive ways? No, of course
not, because this is a story of the fixed mindset. Natural talent should not
need ef f ort. Ef fo rt is for the others, the less endowed. Natural  talent does
not ask for help. It is an admiss ion of weakness. In short, the natural doesnot analyze his deficiencies and coach or practice them away . The very idea
of deficiencies is terrifying.
Being so  imbued with the fixed  mindset, Beane was trapped. T rapped
by h is huge talent. Beane the  player never recovered from the fixed
mindset, but Beane the incredibly successful major -league executive did.
How did this happen?
There was another player who lived and played side by side with Beane
in the minors a nd in the majors, Lenny Dykstra. Dykstra did  not have a
fraction of Beaneâ€™ s physical e ndowment or â€œnatural ability ,â€ but Beane
watched him in awe. As Beane later described, â€œHe had no concept of
failure. . . . And I was the opposite.â€
Beane c ontinues, â€œI started to ge t a sense of what a baseball pla yer was
and I could see it wasnâ€™ t me. It was Lenny .â€
As he watched,  listened, and m ulled it over , it dawned on Beane that
mindset was more important tha n talent. And not long after that, as part of a
group th at pioneered a radically new approach to scouting and managing,
he came to believe that scoring runsâ€”the whole point of baseballâ€”was
much more about process than about talent.
Armed with these insights, Beane, as general manager of the 2002
Oakland Athleti cs, led his team to a season of 103 victoriesâ€”winning the
division championship and almost breaking the American League record for
consecutive wins. The team had the second-lowest payroll in baseball! They
didnâ€™ t buy talent, they bought mindset.
THE IDEA OF THE NA TURAL
Now Y ou See It, Now Y ou Donâ€™ t
Physical endow ment is not like intellectual endowment. Itâ€™ s visible. Size,
build, ag ility are  all visible. Pra ctice and training are also visib le, and they
produce visible results. Y ou wo uld think that this would dispel the myth of
the natural. Y ou could see  Muggsy Bogues at five foot three playing NBA
basketball, and Doug Flutie, the  small quarterback who played for the New
England Patriots  and the San Diego Char gers. Y ou could see Pete Gray , the
one-armed baseball player who made it to the major leagues. Ben Hogan,
one of the greatest golfers of all time, who was completely lacki ng in grace.Glenn C unningham, the great runner , who had badly burned and damaged
legs. Larry Bird and his lack  of swiftness. Y ou can see  the  small or
graceless or even â€œdisabledâ€ one s who make it, and the god-like specimens
who donâ€™ t. Shouldnâ€™ t this tell people something?
Boxing experts relied on physi cal measurements, called â€œtale s of the
tape,â€ to identify naturals. They included measurements of the fighter â€™ s fist,
reach, chest expansion, and weight. Muhammad Ali failed these
measurements. He was not a nat ural. He had great speed but he didnâ€™ t have
the p hysique of a great fighter , he didnâ€™ t have the strength, and he didnâ€™ t
have the classical moves. In fact, he boxed all wrong. He d idnâ€™ t block
punches with his arms and elbows. He punched in rallies like an amateur .
He kept his jaw exposed. He pulled back his torso to evade the impact of
oncoming punch es, which Jose T orres said was â€œlike someone in the middle
of a train track  trying to avoid  being hit by an oncoming train, not by
moving to one or the other side of the track, but by running backwards.â€
Sonny Liston, Aliâ€™ s adversary , was  a natural. He had it allâ€”the size, the
strength, and the experience. His power was legendary . It was unimaginable
that Ali could beat Sonny Liston. The matchup was so ludicrous that the
arena was only half full for the fight.
But asid e from his quickness, Aliâ€™ s brilliance was his mind. His brains,
not his brawn. He sized up his opponent and went for his me ntal jugular .
Not only  did he study Listonâ€™ s f ighting style, but he closely ob served what
kind of person L iston was out o f the ring: â€œI read everything I c ould where
he had been inte rviewed. I talked with people who had been aro und him or
had talked with him. I would lay in bed and put all of the things together
and think about them, and try to get a picture of how his mind worked.â€
And then he turned it against him.
Why did  Ali appear to â€œgo crazyâ€ before each fight? Because , T orres
says, he knew th at a knockout p unch is the one they donâ€™ t see coming. Ali
said, â€œListon had to believe that I was crazy . That I was capable of doing
anything. He couldnâ€™ t see noth ing to me at all but mouth and thatâ€™ s all I
wanted him to see!â€
Float like a butterfly ,
Sting like a bee
Y our hands canâ€™ t hitWhat your eyes canâ€™ t see.
Aliâ€™ s vic tory over Liston is box ing history . A famous boxing manager
reflects on Ali:
â€œHe was a para dox. His physical performances in the ring w ere
absolutely wron g. . . . Y et, his brain was always in perfect wor king
condition.â€ â€œHe showed us all,â€ he continued with a broad smile
written a cross his face, â€œthat al l victories come from here,â€ hitting
his forehead with his index finger . Then he raised a pair of fists,
saying: â€œNot from here.â€
This didnâ€™ t change peopleâ€™ s minds about physical endowment. No, we
just look back at Ali now , with our hindsight, and see the bod y of a great
boxer . It was gravy that his mind was so sharp and that he made up amusing
poems, but we still think his g reatness resided in his physique. And we
donâ€™ t understand how the experts failed to see that greatness right from the
start.
Michael Jordan
Michael Jordan wasnâ€™ t a natural , either . He was the hardest-work ing athlete,
perhaps in the history of sport.
It is  well know n that Michael Jordan was cut from the high  school
varsity teamâ€”we laugh at the coach who cut him. He wasnâ€™ t recruited by
the c ollege he w anted to play fo r (North Carolina State). W ell, w erenâ€™ t they
foolish? He wasnâ€™ t drafted by the first two NBA teams that could have
chosen him. What a blooper! Because now we know he was the greatest
basketball player ever , and we think it should have been obvious from the
start. When we look at him we see MICHAEL JORDAN.  But at that point
he was only Michael Jordan.
When J ordan was cut from the  varsity team, he was devastated. His
mother says, â€œI told him to go  back and discipline himself.â€ Boy , did he
listen. H e used to leave the house at six in the morning to go pra ctice before
school. At the University of No rth Carolina, he constantly worked on his
weaknessesâ€”his defensive game and his ball handling and sh ooting. Thecoach was taken aback by his willingness to work harder than anyone else.
Once, a fter the team lost the last game of the season, Jordan went and
practiced his shots for hours. H e was preparing for the next year . Even at
the height of h is success and fameâ€”after he had made himself into an
athletic geniusâ€”his dogged practice remained legendary . Former Bulls
assistant coach John Bach called him â€œa genius who constant ly wants to
upgrade his genius.â€
For Jordan, success stems from  the mind. â€œThe mental toughn ess and
the heart are a lot stronger than some of the physical advantages you might
have. Iâ€™ve always said that and Iâ€™ve always believed that.â€ But other people
donâ€™ t. T hey look  at Michael Jord an and they see the physical perfection that
led inevitably to his greatness.
The Babe
What ab out Bab e Ruth? Now , h e was clearly no vessel of human physical
perfection. Here  was the guy with the famous appetites and a gi ant stomach
bulging out of h is Y ankee uniform. W ow , doesnâ€™ t that make him even more
of a natu ral? Did nâ€™ t he just caro use all night and then kind of sa unter to the
plate the next day and punch out home runs?
The Bab e was not a natural, eith er . At the beginning of his professional
career , B abe Ruth was not that good a hitter . He had a lot of po wer , power
that cam e from his total commit ment each time he swung the bat. When he
connected, it was breathtaking, but he was highly inconsistent.
Itâ€™ s true that he could consume astounding amounts of liquor and
unheard-of amo unts of food. After a huge meal, he could eat o ne or more
whole pies for d essert. But he co uld also discipline himself when he had to.
Many winters, he worked out the entire of f-season at the gym to become
more fit. In fact, after the 1925 season, when it looked as tho ugh he was
washed up, he r eally committed  himself to getting in shape, and it worked.
From 19 26 thro ugh 1931, he b atted .354, averaging 50 home runs a year
and 155  runs batted in. Robert C reamer , his biographer , says, â€œRuth put on
the f inest display of sustained h itting that baseball has ever see n. . . . From
the ashes of 1925, Babe Ruth rose like a rocket.â€ Through discipline.
He a lso loved to practice. In fact, when he joined the Boston Red Sox,
the veterans resented him for wanting to take batting practice every day . Hewasnâ€™ t just a rookie; he was a rookie pitcher .  Who did he th ink he was,
trying to take batting practice? One time, later in his career , he was
disciplined and was banned fro m a game. That was one thing. But they
wouldnâ€™ t let him practice, either , and that r eally  hurt.
T y Cobb  ar gued that being a pitcher helped Ruth develop his hitting.
Why wo uld bein g a pitcher hel p his batting? â€œHe could experi ment at the
plate,â€ C obb sai d. â€œNo one cares much if a pitcher strikes out or looks bad
at bat, so Ruth could take that big swing. If he missed, it didnâ€™ t matter . . . .
As time  went on, he learned mo re and more about how to control that big
swing a nd put the wood on the ball. By the time he became a fulltime
outfielder , he was ready .â€
Y et we cling fast to what Stephen Jay Gould calls â€œthe common view
that ball players are hunks of me at, naturally and ef fortlessly displaying the
talents that nature provided.â€
The Fastest W omen on Earth
What about W ilma Rudolph, hailed as the fastest woman on earth after she
won three gold medals for sprints and relay in the 1960 Rome Olympics?
She was far fro m a physical wonder as a youngster . She was a premature
baby , th e twentieth of twenty-two children born to her parents, and a
constantly sick child. At four years of age, she nearly died of a long
struggle with double pneumonia, scarlet fever , and polio(!), emer ging with a
mostly p aralyzed left leg. Doctors gave her little hope of ever using it again.
For eight years, she vigorously p ursued physical therapy , until at age twelve
she shed her leg brace and began to walk normally .
If this wasnâ€™ t a  lesson that physical skills could be developed, what
was? She immediately went and  applied that lesson to basketba ll and track,
although she lost every race she entered in her first of ficial track meet. After
her incredible career , she said , â€œI just want to be remembered as a
hardworking lady .â€
What about Jackie Joyner -Kersee, hailed as the greatest female athlete
of a ll time? Be tween 1985 and the beginning of 1996, she won every
heptathlon she competed in. What exactly is a heptathlon? Itâ€™ s  a grueling
two-day , seven-part event consi sting of a 100-meter hurdles race, the high
jump, th e javelin  throw , a 200-m eter sprint, the long jump, the shotput, andan 800-m eter ru n. No wonder the winner gets to be called the best female
athlete in the w orld. Along the way , Joyner -Kersee earned the  six highest
scores in the hi story of the sport, set world records, and won two world
championships as well as two Olympic gold medals (six if we count the
ones in other events).
W as she a natu ral? T alent she had, but when she started tra ck, she
finished in last p lace for quite so me time. The longer she worked, the faster
she got, but she still didnâ€™ t win any races. Finally , she began to  win. What
changed? â€œSome might attribute my transformation to the laws o f heredity . .
. . But I think it  was my reward for all those hours of work o n the bridle
path, the neighborhood sidewalks and the schoolhouse corridors.â€
Sharing the secret of her co ntinued success, she says, â€œThere is
something about seeing myself improve that motivates and excites me. Itâ€™ s
that way  now , after six Olympic  medals and five world records. And it was
the way I was in junior high, just starting to enter track meets.â€
Her last two medals (a world-championship and an Olympic medal)
came du ring an asthma attack and a severe, painful hamstring injury . It was
not natural talent taking its course. It was mindset having its say .
Naturals Shouldnâ€™ t Need Ef fort
Did you know there was once a strong belief that you couldnâ€™ t physically
train for golf, and that if you built your strength you would  lose your
â€œtouchâ€? Until T iger W oods c ame along with his workout r egimes and
fierce practice habits and won every tournament there was to win.
In some  cultures, people who tried to go beyond their natural talent
through training received sharp disapproval. Y ou were suppose d to accept
your sta tion in life. These cultures would have hated Maury W ills. W ills
was an eager ba seball player in the 1950s and â€™60s with a dream to be a
major le aguer . His problem was that his hitting wasnâ€™ t good enough, so
when th e Dodge rs signed him, they sent him down to the minor leagues. He
proudly announced to his friends, â€œIn two years, Iâ€™m going to be in
Brooklyn playing with Jackie Robinson.â€
He was  wrong. Despite his optimistic prediction and grueling daily
practice, he languished in the minors for eight and a half years. At the
seven-and-a-half-year mark, the team manager made a batting suggestion,telling W ills, â€œY ouâ€™re in a seven-and-a-half-year slump, you have nothing to
lose.â€ S hortly thereafter , when the Dodger shortstop broke his toe, W ills
was called up. He had his chance.
His batting was still  not good enough. Not ready to give up, he went to
the f irst-base coach for help; they worked together several hours  a day aside
from W i llsâ€™ s regular practice. Still not good enough. Even the gritty W ills
was now  ready to quit, but the f irst-base coach refused to let him . Now that
the mechanics were in place, W ills needed work on his mind.
He bega n to hitâ€”and, with his great speed, he began to steal b ases. He
studied the throws of the oppos ing pitchers and catchers, figuring out the
best moment to steal a base. H e developed sudden, powerful takeof fs and
ef fective slides.  His stealing be gan to distract the pitchers, th row of f the
catchers, and thrill the fans. W ills went on to break T y Cobbâ€™ s record for
stolen b ases, a record unchallenged for forty-seven years. That season, he
was voted the most valuable player in the National League.
Sports IQ
Y ou wo uld think  the sports world would have  t o see t he relat ion between
practice and improvementâ€”and between the mind and performanceâ€”and
stop har ping so much on innate  physical talent. Y et itâ€™ s almost as if they
refuse to see. Pe rhaps itâ€™ s because, as Malcolm Gladwell suggests, people
prize natural endowment over e arned ability . As much as our culture talks
about in dividual ef fort and self-improvement, deep down, he  ar gues, we
revere the naturals. W e like to think of our champions and idols as
superheroes wh o were born dif ferent from us. W e donâ€™ t like to think of
them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary .
Why not? T o me that is so much more amazing.
Even when experts are willing to recognize the role of the mind, they
continue to insist that itâ€™ s all innate!
This rea lly hit me when I came  upon an article about Marshal l Faulk,
the great running back for the S t. Louis Rams football team. Fa ulk had just
become the first player to gain a combined two thousand r ushing and
receiving yards in four consecutive seasons.
The article, written on the eve of the 2002 Super Bowl, talked about
Faulkâ€™ s uncanny skill at knowing where every player on the field is, even inthe swir ling chaos of twenty-two running and falling players. H e not only
knows where they are, but he also knows what they are doing , and what
they are about  to do. According to his teammates, heâ€™ s never wrong.
Incredible. How  does he do it? As Faulk tells it, he spent years and
years watching football. In high school he even got a job as a ballpark
vendor , which he hated, in orde r to watch pro football. As he watched, he
was always asking the question Why?:  â€œWhy are we running this play?â€
â€œWhy are we attacking it this way?â€ â€œWhy are they doing that?â€ â€œWhy are
they doi ng this?â€ â€œThat question,â€ Faulk says, â€œbasically got me  involved in
football in a more in-depth way .â€ As a pro, he never stopped asking why
and probing deeper into the workings of the game.
Clearly , Faulk himself sees his skills as the product of his insatiable
curiosity and study .
How do  players and coaches see it? As a gift. â€œMarshall has the highest
football IQ of a ny position player Iâ€™ve ever played with,â€ says a veteran
teammate. Other teammates describe his ability to recognize defensive
alignments flawlessly as a â€œsavantâ€™ s gift.â€ In awe of his array of skills, one
coach explained: â€œIt takes a very innate football intelligence to do all that.â€
â€œCHARACTERâ€
But arenâ€™ t there some naturals, athletes who really seem to have â€œitâ€ from
the start? Y es, a nd as it was for Billy Beane and John McEnroe , sometimes
itâ€™ s a curse. W ith all the praise for their talent and with how little theyâ€™ve
needed to work or stretch themselves, they can easily fall into a fixed
mindset. Bruce Jenner (now Ca itlyn Jenner), 1976 Olympic gold medalist
in th e de cathlon, says, â€œIf I was nâ€™ t dyslexic, I probably wouldnâ€™ t have won
the Games. If I had been a better reader , then that would have come easily ,
sports would have come easily .  . . and I never would have realized that the
way you get ahead in life is hard work.â€
The naturals, carried away wit h their superiority , donâ€™ t learn how to
work ha rd or how to cope with setbacks. This is the story of Pedro
Martinez, the brilliant pitcher then with the Boston Red Sox , who self-
destructed when they needed him most. But itâ€™ s an even lar ger story too, a
story about character .A group  of sportswriters from The New Y ork T imes  and The Boston
Globe  w ere on the Delta shuttle to Bo ston. So was I. They were headed to
Game 3  of the 2003 American  League play-of f series between the New
Y ork Y ankees and the Boston Red Sox. They were talking about character ,
and they all agr eedâ€”the Boston writers reluctantlyâ€”that the Y ankees had
it.
Among other things, they remembered what the Y ankees had done for
New Y ork two years before. It was October 2001, and New Y orkers had just
lived th rough September 1 1. I was there and we were devastated. W e
needed some hope. The city nee ded the Y ankees to go for itâ€”to go for the
W orld S eries. B ut the Y ankees had lived through it, too, and they were
injured and exhausted. They seemed to have nothing left. I donâ€™ t know
where they got it from, but they dug down deep and they polished of f one
team after another , each win bringing us a little bit back to life, each one
giving u s a little more hope for t he future. Fueled by our need, they became
the A merican League East cham ps, then the American League c hamps, and
then the y were in the W orld S eries, where they made a valiant run and
almost pulled it of f. Everyone hates the Y ankees. Itâ€™ s the team the whole
country roots against. I grew up  hating the Y ankees, too, but after that I had
to love them. This is what the sportswriters meant by character .
Character , the sportswriters said . They know it when they see itâ€”itâ€™ s
the abili ty to dig down and find the strength even when thing s are going
against you.
The very next day , Pedro Martinez, the dazzling but over -pa mpered
Boston pitcher , showed what character meant. By showing what it isnâ€™ t.
No one could have wanted this American League Championship more
than the  Boston  Red Sox. They  hadnâ€™ t won a W orld Series in eighty-five
years, ev er since  the curse of the Bambinoâ€”that is, ever since  Sox owner
Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to the Y ankees for money to finance a
Broadway show . It was bad enough that he was selling the best  left-handed
pitcher i n baseb all (which Ruth was at the time), but he was selling him to
the despised enemy .
The Y an kees went on to domina te baseball, winning, it seemed, endless
W orld S eries. M eanwhile Bosto n made it to four W orld Series and several
play-of fs, but they always lost. And they always lost in the mos t tragic way
possible. By coming achingly n ear to victory and then having a meltdown.Here, fi nally , was another chance to fight of f the curse and  defeat their
archrivals. If they won, they would make that trip to the W orld  Series and
the Y ankees would stay home. Pedro Martinez was their ho pe. In fact,
earlier in the season, he had cursed the curse.
Y et after pitching a beautiful game, Martinez was losing his lead and
falling behind. What did he do then? He hit a batter with the ball (Karim
Garcia), threaten ed to bean another (Jor ge Posada), and hurled a seventy-
two-year -old man to the ground (Y ankee coach Don Zimmer).
As New Y ork T imes  writer Jack Cur ry wrote: â€œW e knew we were going
to h ave Pedro vs. Roger [Clem ens] on a memorable afternoon at Fenway
Park. . . . But no  one expected to  watch Pedro against Garcia, P edro against
Posada, Pedro against Zimmer .â€
Even the Boston writers were a ghast. Dan Shaughnessy , of the Globe,
asked: â€œ Which one would you rather have now , Red Sox fans? Roger
Clemens, who kept his composure and behaved like a professional Saturday
night, w inning the game for his team despite his obvious anger? Or
Martinez, the baby who hits a gu y after he blows the lead, then points at his
head and  at Y ankees catcher Jor ge Posada, threatening, â€˜Y ouâ€™re nextâ€™? . . .
Red Sox  fans donâ€™ t like to hea r this, but Martinez was an embarrassment
Saturday , and a disgrace to baseball. He gets away with it because heâ€™ s
Pedro. And the Sox front of fice enables him. Could Martinez one time stand
up and admit heâ€™ s wrong?â€
Like Billy Beane, Pedro Mar tinez did not know how to tolerate
frustration, did not know how to dig down and turn an impor tant setback
into an important win. Nor , like  Billy Beane, could he admit his faults and
learn from them. Because he threw his tantrum instead of doing the job, the
Y ankees won the game and went on to win the play-of f by one game.
The spo rtswriters on the plane agreed that character is all. But they
confessed that they didnâ€™ t unde rstand where it comes from. Y e t I think by
now weâ€™re getting the idea that character grows out of mindset.
W e now know that there is a m indset in which people are enmeshed in
the idea  of their own talent and  specialness. When things go wrong, they
lose their focus and their ability , putting everything they wantâ€” and in this
case, everything the team and the fans so desperately wantâ€”in jeopardy .
W e also know t hat there is a mindset that helps people cope w ell with
setbacks, points them to good st rategies, and leads them to act in their bestinterest.
W ait. Th e storyâ€™ s not over . One year later , the Sox and the Y anke es went
head-to-head again. Whoever won four games out of the seven would be the
American Leagu e Champions and would take that trip to the W orld Series.
The Y ankees won the first th ree games, and Bostonâ€™ s humiliating fate
seemed sealed once again.
But that  year Boston had put the ir prima donnas on notice. The y traded
one, tried to trad e another (no o ne wanted him), and sent out the message:
This is a team, not a bunch of stars. W e work hard for each other .
Four games later , the Boston Red Sox were the American League
Champions. And then the W orld Champions. It was the first time since
1904 tha t Boston had beaten the Y ankees in a championship series, showing
two thin gs. First, that the curse was over . And second, that char acter can be
learned.
More About Character
Letâ€™ s tak e it from the top with Pete Sampras and the growth mindset. In
2000, Sampras was at W imbledon, trying for his thirteenth Grand Slam
tennis victory . If he won, he would break Roy Emersonâ€™ s record of twelve
wins in top tou rnaments. Although Sampras managed to ma ke it to the
finals, h e had not played that well in the tournament and was not optimistic
about his chances against the young, powerful Patrick Rafter .
Sampras lost the first set, and was about to lose the second set.  He was
down 4â€“1 in the tiebreaker . Eve n he said, â€œI really felt like it was slipping
away .â€ W hat would McEnroe have done? What would Pedro Martinez have
done? What did Sampras do?
As W illiam Rhoden puts it, â€œHe . . . searched for a frame of reference
that cou ld carry him through.â€ Sampras says, â€œWhen youâ€™re si tting on the
changeover you think of past matches that youâ€™ve lost the first set . . . came
back and won the next three. Thereâ€™ s time. Y ou reflect on your past
experiences, being able to get through it.â€
Suddenly , Samp ras had a five-p oint run. Then two more. He had won
the second set and he was alive.
â€œLast ni ght,â€ Rhoden says, â€œSampras displayed all the qualities of the
hero: the  loss in the first set, vulnerability near defeat, then a comeback anda final triumph.â€
Jackie Joyner -Kersee talked hers elf through an asthma attack during her
last wor ld cham pionship. She was in the 800-meter race, the last event of
the heptathlon, when she felt t he attack coming on. â€œJust kee p pumping
your arm s,â€ she instructed herself. â€œItâ€™ s not that bad, so keep goi ng. Y ou can
make it. Y ouâ€™re not going to hav e a full-blown attack. Y ou have enough air .
Y ouâ€™ve got this thing won. . . . Just run as hard as you can in this last 200
meters, Jackie.â€  She instructed herself all the way to victory . â€œI have to say
this is my greatest triumph, considering the competition and the ups and
downs I was g oing through. . . . If I really wanted it, I had to pull it
together .â€
In h er last Olym pics, the dreaded thing happened. A serious ha mstring
injury fo rced her to drop out of t he heptathlon. She was devastated. She was
no longer a cont ender in her signature event, but would she be a contender
in the long jump a few days lat er? Her first five jumps said no. They were
nowhere near medal level. But  the sixth jump won her a bro nze medal,
more precious than her gold ones. â€œThe strength for that sixth jump came
from my assorted heartbreaks o ver the years . . . Iâ€™d collected all my pains
and turned them into one mighty performance.â€
Joyner -Kersee, too, displayed all the qualities of a hero: the loss, the
vulnerability near defeat, then a comeback and a final triumph.
Character , Heart, W ill, and the Mind of a Champion
It go es by dif fe rent names, but itâ€™ s the same thing. Itâ€™ s what makes you
practice, and itâ€™ s what allows you to dig down and pull it out when you
most need it.
Remember how McEnroe told us all the things that went wrong to make
him lose each match he lost? There was the time it was cold and the time it
was hot,  the time he was jealous and the times he was upset, an d the many ,
many times he w as distracted. But, as Billie Jean King tells us, the mark of
a champion is the ability to win when things are not quite rightâ€”when
youâ€™re not playing well and your emotions are not the right ones. Hereâ€™ s
how she learned what being a champion meant.
King wa s in the finals at Forest Hills playing against Mar gare t Smith
(later M ar garet Smith Court), who was at the peak of her grea tness. Kinghad played her more than a dozen times and had beaten her on ly once. In
the f irst set, Kin g played fabulously . She didnâ€™ t miss a volley and built a
nice lead. Suddenly , the set was over . Smith had won it.
In th e se cond se t, King again bu ilt a commanding lead and was  serving
to win the set. Before she knew it, Smith had won the set and the match.
At first,  King was perplexed. She had never built such a comm anding
lead in such an important match. But then she had a Eur eka!  moment. All at
once, she understood what a cha mpion was: someone who could raise their
level of play when they neede d to. When the match is on th e line, they
suddenly â€œget around three times tougher .â€
Jackie Joyner -Kersee had her Eur eka!  m omen t too. She was fifteen
years old and c ompeting in the heptathlon at the AAU Junio r Olympics.
Everything now depended on the last event, the 800-meter rac e, an event
she drea ded. She was exhausted and she was competing again st an expert
distance runner whose times sh e had never matched. She did this time. â€œI
felt a kind of hig h. Iâ€™d proven that I could win if I wanted it badly enough. .
. . That win show ed me that I could not only compete with the b est athletes
in the country , I could will  myself to win.â€
Often ca lled the best woman s occer player in the world, Mia Hamm
says she  was always asked, â€œMia, what is the most important thing for a
soccer player to have?â€ W ith  no hesitation, she answered, â€œMental
toughness.â€ And  she didnâ€™ t mean some innate trait. When ele ven players
want to knock you down, when youâ€™re tired or injured, when the referees
are agai nst you, you canâ€™ t let any of it af fect your focus. How do you do
that? Y ou have to learn  how . â€œIt is,â€ said Hamm, â€œone of the most dif ficult
aspects of soccer and the one I struggle with every game and every
practice.â€
By t he way , did  Hamm think sh e was the greatest player in the world?
No. â€œAnd because of that,â€ she said, â€œsomeday I just might be.â€
In s ports, there are always do -or -die situations, when a player must
come through or itâ€™ s all over . Jack Nicklaus, the famed golfer , was in these
situations many times in his lo ng professional career on the P GA T ourâ€”
where the tournament rested on his making a must-have shot. If  you had to
guess, how many of these shots do you think he missed? The answer is one.
One!Thatâ€™ s the championship mentality . Itâ€™ s how people who are not as
talented as their opponents win games. John W ooden, the legendary
basketball coach, tells one of my favorite stories. Once, while W ooden was
still a high school coach, a player was unhappy because he wasnâ€™ t included
in the big games . The player , Ed die Pawelski, begged W ooden to give him a
chance, and W ooden relented. â€œAll right Eddie,â€ he said, â€œIâ€™ll giv e you a
chance. Iâ€™ll start you against Fort W ayne Central tomorrow night.â€
â€œSuddenly ,â€ W o oden tells us, â€œI wondered where those word s came
from.â€ T hree tea ms were locked in a battle for number one in Indianaâ€”one
was his team and another was Fort W ayne Central, tomorrow nightâ€™ s team.
The nex t night, W ooden started Eddie. He figured that Eddie would last
at most a minute or two, especially since he was up against Fort W ayneâ€™ s
Armstrong, the toughest player in the state.
â€œEddie literally took him apart, â€ W ooden reports. â€œArmstrong got the
lowest point total of his career . Eddie scored 12, and our team showed the
best balance of all season. . . . But in addition to his scoring, his defense,
rebounding, and play-making w ere excellent.â€ Eddie never sat out again
and was named most valuable player for the next two years.
All of these people had character . None of them thought they were
special people, born with the right to win. They were people who worked
hard, w ho learned how to ke ep their focus under pressure, and who
stretched beyond their ordinary abilities when they had to.
Staying on T op
Character is what allows you to reach the top and stay ther e.  Darryl
Strawberry , Mik e T yson, and Martina Hingis reached the top, but they
didnâ€™ t st ay there . Isnâ€™ t that beca use they had all kinds of personal problems
and inju ries? Y e s, but so have many other champions. Ben Ho gan was hit
by a bus and was physically destroyed, but he made it back to the top.
â€œI be lieve ability can get you to the top,â€ says coach John W ooden, â€œbut
it takes character to keep you th ere. . . . Itâ€™ s so easy to . . . begin thinking
you can just â€˜turn it onâ€™ automatically , without proper preparation. It takes
real cha racter to  keep working as hard or even harder once y ouâ€™re there.
When you read about an athlete  or team that wins over and ov er and over ,
remind yourself, â€˜More than ability , they have character .â€™ â€Letâ€™ s tak e an even deeper look at what character means, and how the
growth mindset creates it. Stuart Biddle and his colleagues measured
adolescentsâ€™ and young adultsâ€™ mindset about athletic ability . Those with
the fixed mindset were the people who believed that:
â€œY ou ha ve a certain level of ability in sports and you cannot r eally do
much to change that level.â€
â€œT o be good at sports you need to be naturally gifted.â€
In contrast, the people with the growth mindset agreed that:
â€œHow go od you are at sports will always  i mp rove if you work harder at
it.â€
â€œT o be successful in sports, you need to learn techniques and skills and
practice them regularly .â€
Those with the growth mindset were the ones who showed the most
character or heart. They were the ones who had the minds of champions.
What do I mean? Letâ€™ s look at the findings from these sports researchers
and see.
WHA T IS SUCCESS?
Finding #1: Those with the growth mindset found success in doing their
best, in learning and improving. And this is exactly what we  find in the
champions.
â€œFor me the jo y of athletics has never resided in winning,â€  Jackie
Joyner -Kersee tells us, â€œ. . . I derive just as much happines s from the
process as from the results. I donâ€™ t mind losing as long as I see
improvement or I feel Iâ€™ve done as well as I possibly could. If I lose, I just
go back to the track and work some more.â€
This ideaâ€”that  personal success is when you work your ha rdest to
become your bestâ€”was central to John W oodenâ€™ s life. In fact, he says,
â€œthere w ere man y , many games that gave me as much pleasure a s any of the
ten national championship games we won, simply because w e prepared
fully and played near our highest level of ability .â€
T iger W oods and Mia Hamm a re two of the fiercest competitors who
ever live d. They  love to win, but what counted most for them is the ef fort
they made even when they didnâ€™ t win. They could be proud of that.
McEnroe and Beane could not.After the â€™98 Masters tournament, W oods was disappointed that he did
not repeat his win of the previous year , but he felt good about his top-ten
finish: â€œI squeezed the towel d ry this week. Iâ€™m very proud of the way I
hung in there.â€ Or after a British Open, where he fini shed third:
â€œSometimes you get even more satisfaction out of creating a score when
things ar enâ€™ t completely perfect, when youâ€™re not feeling so wel l about your
swing.â€
T iger is a hugely ambitious man . He wants to be the best, even the best
ever . â€œBut the best meâ€”thatâ€™ s a little more important.â€
Mia Hamm tells us, â€œAfter every game or practice, if you walk of f the
field knowing that you gave everything you had, you will always be a
winner .â€ Why did the country fa ll in love with her team? â€œThey saw that we
truly love what we do and that w e gave everything we had to each other and
to each game.â€
For those with the fixed mind set, success is about establishing their
superiority , pure  and simple. Be ing that somebody who is worth ier than the
nobodies. â€œTher e was a timeâ€”I â€™ll admit it,â€ McEnroe says, â€œwh en my head
was so big it could barely fit through the door .â€ Whereâ€™ s the talk about
ef fort and personal best? There is none. â€œSome people donâ€™ t want to
rehearse; they just want to perform. Other people want to practice a hundred
times first. Iâ€™m in the former group.â€ Remember , in the fixed mindset, ef fort
is not a cause for pride. It is something that casts doubt on your talent.
WHA T IS F AILURE?
Finding #2: Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating.
Theyâ€™re informative. Theyâ€™re a wake-up call.
Only on ce did Michael Jordan tr y to coast. It was the year he returned to
the Bull s after his stint in baseball, and he learned his lesson. The Bulls
were eli minated in the play-of fs. â€œY ou canâ€™ t leave and think you can come
back an d dominate this game. I will be physically and mentally prepared
from now on.â€ T ruer words are rarely spoken. The Bulls won the NBA title
the next three years.
Michael Jordan embraced his fa ilures. In fact, in one of his favo rite ads
for Nike , he says: â€œIâ€™ve missed more than nine thousand shots. Iâ€™ve lost
almost three hundred games. T wenty-six times, Iâ€™ve been trusted to take thegame-winning shot, and missed.â€ Y ou can be sure that each time, he went
back and practiced the shot a hundred times.
Hereâ€™ s how Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , the great basketball player , reacted
when college basketball outla wed his signature shot, the dunk (later
reinstated). Man y thought that would stop his ascent to greatne ss. Instead,
he w orked twice as hard on developing other shots: his bank shot of f the
glass, his skyhook, and his turnaround jumper . He had absorbed  the growth
mindset from Coach W ooden, and put it to good use.
In the fixed mindset, setbacks label you.
John McEnroe could never stand the thought of losing. Even worse was
the thought of losing to someon e who was a friend or relative. That would
make him less special. For example, he hoped desperately for his best
friend, Peter , to lose in the fina ls at Maui after Peter had beaten him in an
earlier r ound. H e wanted it so badly he couldnâ€™ t watch the match. Another
time, he  played  his brother Patrick in a finals in Chicago, and said to
himself, â€œGod, if I lose to Pa trick, thatâ€™ s it. Iâ€™m jumping of f the Sears
tower .â€
Hereâ€™ s h ow failure motivated him. In 1979, he played mixed doubles at
W imbledon. He didnâ€™ t play mixed doubles again for twenty years. Why? He
and his partner lost in three straight sets. Plus, McEnroe lost his serve twice,
while no one else lost theirs even once. â€œThat was the ultimate
embarrassment. I said, â€˜Thatâ€™ s it. Iâ€™m never playing again. I canâ€™ t handle
this.â€™ â€
In 1981, McEnroe bought a beautiful black Les Paul guitar . That week,
he went to see Buddy Guy play at the Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago.
Instead o f feeling inspired to take lessons or practice, McEnroe  went home
and smashed his guitar to pieces.
Hereâ€™ s h ow failure motivated Ser gio Garcia, another golden boy with
mindset issues. Garcia had tak en the golf world by storm with his great
shots and his charming, boyish ways; he seemed like a younger T iger . But
when his performance took a di ve, so did his charm. He fired caddie after
caddie, b laming them for everything that went wrong. He once blamed his
shoe wh en he slipped and missed a shot. T o punish the shoe, he threw it and
kicked i t. Unfortunately , he almost hit an of ficial. These are the ingenious
remedies for failure in the fixed mindset.T AKING CHARGE OF SUCCESS
Finding #3: People with the growth mindset in sports (as in pre-med
chemistry) took char ge of the processes that bring successâ€”and that
maintain it.
How come Michael Jordanâ€™ s sk ill didnâ€™ t seem to decline with age? He
did lose  some stamina and agility with age, but to compensate, he worked
even harder on conditioning and on his moves, like the turnaround jump
shot and  his celebrated fallaway jumper . He came into the league as a slam-
dunker and he left as the most complete player ever to grace the game.
W oods, too, took char ge of the process. Golf is like a waywar d lover .
When yo u think youâ€™ve conquered her , she will certainly desert  you. Butch
Harmon, the renowned coach, says â€œthe golf swing is just about the farthest
thing fro m a perfectible discipline in athletics. . . . The most reliable swings
are only  relatively repeatable. They never stop being works in progress.â€
Thatâ€™ s why even the biggest go lf star wins only a fraction of th e time, and
may not  win for long periods of time (which happened to W oods even at the
height of his car eer). And thatâ€™ s also why taking char ge of the process is so
crucial.
W ith this in mind, T iger â€™ s dad made sure to teach him how to manage
his a ttention and his course strategy . Mr . W oods would make loud noises or
throw things just as little T iger was about to swing. This helped him
become less distractible. (Do we know someone else who could have
profited from this training?) When T iger was three years old, his dad was
already teaching him to think ab out course management. After T iger drove
the b all behind a big clump of t rees, Mr . W oods asked the todd ler what his
plan was.
W oods c arried on what his dad started by taking control of all parts of
his game. He experimented constantly with what worked and what didnâ€™ t,
but he also had a long-term plan that guided him: â€œI know my game. I know
what I want to achieve, I know how to get there.â€
Like Michael Jordan, W oods managed his motivation. He did this by
making his practice into fun: â€œI love working on shots, carving them this
way and that, and proving to myself that I can hit a certain shot on
command.â€ And  he did it by thinking of a rival out there somewhere whowould challenge  him: â€œHeâ€™ s twelve. I have to give myself a rea son to work
so hard. Heâ€™ s out there somewhere. Heâ€™ s twelve.â€
Mark Oâ€™Meara, W oodsâ€™ s golf p artner and friend, had a choice. Itâ€™ s not
easy to play bes ide someone as extraordinary as W oods. Oâ€™Mearaâ€™ s choice
was this : He could feel jealous o f and diminished by W oodsâ€™ s su perior play ,
or h e could learn from it. He c hose the latter path. Oâ€™Meara was one of
those talented players who neve r seemed to fulfill his potential . His choice
â€”to take char ge of his gameâ€”turned him around.
At t he age of twenty-one, W oods had won the Masters T our nament.
That night, he slept with his arms around his prize, the famous g reen jacket.
One year later , he put a green jacket on Mark Oâ€™Meara.
From McEnroe, we hear little talk of taking control. When he was on
top, we hear little mention of wo rking on his game to stay on to p. When he
was doing poorly , we hear little self-reflection or analysis (except to pin the
blame). For example, when he d idnâ€™ t do as well as expected for part of â€™82,
we h ear that â€œlittle things happe ned that kept me of f my game f or weeks at
a time and prevented me from dominating the tour .â€
Always a victim of outside forces. Why didnâ€™ t he take char ge a nd learn
how to perform well in spite of them? Thatâ€™ s not the way o f the fixed
mindset. In fact, rather than combating those forces or fixing his problems,
he te lls u s he wished he played a team sport, so he could concea l his flaws:
â€œIf youâ€™re not at your peak, you can hide it so much easier in a team sport.â€
McEnroe also admits that his on-court temper tantrums were often a
cover for choking and only made things worse. So what did he do? Nothing.
He wished someone else would do it for him. â€œWhen you canâ€™ t control
yourself, you want someone to do it for youâ€”thatâ€™ s where I acu tely missed
being pa rt of a team sport. . . . P eople would have worked with me, coached
me.â€
Or: â€œThe system let me get away with more and more . . . I really liked
it less and less.â€ He got mad at  the system! Hi there, John. This was your
life. Ever think of taking responsibility?
No, because in the fixed mindset, you donâ€™ t take control of your abilities
and you r motiv ation. Y ou look for your talent to carry you th rough, and
when it doesnâ€™ t, well then, wha t else could you have done? Y ou are not a
work in progress, youâ€™re a finis hed product. And finished products have to
protect themselves, lament, and blame. Everything but take char ge.WHA T DOES IT MEAN T O BE A ST AR?
Does a star have less responsibi lity to the team than other players? Is it just
their role to b e great and w in games? Or does a star have mor e
responsibility than others? What does Michael Jordan think?
â€œIn our society sometimes itâ€™ s h ard to come to grips with filling a role
instead of trying to be a superstar ,â€ says Jordan. A superstar â€™ s talent can win
games, but itâ€™ s teamwork that wins championships.
Coach John W ooden claims he was tactically and strategically average.
So h ow did he win ten national championships? One of the m ain reasons,
he tells us, is be cause he was go od at getting players to fill roles as part of a
team.  â€œI belie ve, for example, I could have made Kareem [Abdul-J abbar]
the g reatest scorer in college history . I could have done that by  developing
the team around that ability of his. W ould we have won th ree national
championships while he was at UCLA? Never .â€
In the fixed min dset, athletes want to validate their talent. This means
acting like a su perstar , not â€œjustâ€ a team member . But, as with Pedro
Martinez, this mindset works against the important victories they want to
achieve.
A tellin g tale is the story of P atrick Ewing, who could have been a
basketball cham pion. The year Ewing was a draft pickâ€”by far the most
exciting pick of the yearâ€”the K nicks won the lottery and to their joy got to
select E wing for their team. Th ey now had â€œtwin towers,â€ the seven-foot
Ewing and the seven-foot Bill Cartwright, their high-scoring center . They
had a chance to do it all.
They jus t needed  Ewing to be the power forward. He wasnâ€™ t happy with
that. Center is the star position. And maybe he wasnâ€™ t sure he could hit the
outside shots that a power forward has to hit. What if he had really given
his all to learn that position? (A lex Rodriguez, then the best shortstop in
baseball, agreed to play third ba se when he joined the Y ankees. He had to
retrain himself and, for a while, he wasnâ€™ t all he had bee n.) Instead,
Cartwright was  sent to the Bulls, and Ewingâ€™ s Knicks never won a
championship.
Then there is the  tale of the football player Keyshawn Johnson,  another
immensely talented player who was devoted to validatin g his own
greatness. When asked before a game how he compared to a st ar player onthe oppo sing tea m, he replied, â€œY ouâ€™re trying to compare a flashlight to a
star . Flashlights only last so long. A star is in the sky forever .â€
W as he a team player? â€œI am a team player , but Iâ€™m an individu al first. .
. . I hav e to be t he No. 1 guy with the football. Not No. 2 or No. 3. If Iâ€™m
not the No. 1 guy , Iâ€™m no good to you. I canâ€™ t really help you.â€ What does
that  m ean? For his definition of team player ,  Johnson was traded by the
Jets, and, after that, deactivated by the T ampa Bay Buccaneers.
Iâ€™ve noticed an interesting thing. When some star players are
interviewed afte r a game, they say we.  They are part of the team and they
think of  themsel ves that way . W hen others are interviewed, they say I  and
they refer to th eir teammates as something apart from them selvesâ€”as
people who are privileged to participate in their greatness.
Every Sport Is a T eam Sport
Y ou know , just about every sport is in some sense a team sport. No one does
it alone.  Even in individual spo rts, like tennis or golf, great athletes have a
teamâ€”coaches, trainers, caddies, managers, mentors. This really hit me
when I read about Diana Nyad, the woman who holds the worldâ€™ s record for
open-water swimming. What could be more of a lone sport than swimming?
All right, maybe you need a little rowboat to follow you and make sure
youâ€™re okay .
When N yad hatched her plan, th e open-water swimming record for both
men and women was sixty miles. She wanted to swim one hundred. After
months of arduous training, sh e was ready . But with her went a team of
guides (for measuring the winds and the current, and watching for
obstacles), dive rs (looking for sharks), NASA experts (for guidance on
nutrition and enduranceâ€”she ne eded eleven hundred calories per hour and
she lost twenty-nine pounds on the trip!), and trainers who talked her
through uncontrollable shivers, nausea, hallucinations, and despair . Her new
record was 102.5 miles. It was  her name in the record books, but it took
fifty-one other people to do it.
HEARING THE MINDSETS
Y ou can already hear the mindsets in young athletes. Listen for them.Itâ€™ s 2004 . Iciss T illis is a college basketball star , a six-foot-five forward
for t he D uke Un iversity women â€™ s basketball team. She has a picture of her
father , J ames â€œQ uickâ€ T illis, taped to her locker as a motivator . â€œBut the
picture i s not a t ribute,â€ says sportswriter V iv Bernstein. â€œIt is a reminder of
all T illis hopes she will never be.â€
Quick T illis wa s a contender in the 1980s. In â€™81, he boxed for the
world he avyweight title; in â€™85, he was in the movie The Color Purple  (as a
boxer); and in â€™86, he was the first boxer to go the distance (ten rounds)
with Mike T yson. But he never made it to the top.
Iciss T illis, who is a senior , says, â€œThis is the year to win a national
championship. I just feel like Iâ€™d be such a failure . . . [Iâ€™d] feel like Iâ€™m
regressing back and Iâ€™m going to end up like my dad: a nobody .â€
Uh-oh, itâ€™ s the s omebodyâ€“nobody syndrome. If I win, Iâ€™ll be somebody;
if I lose Iâ€™ll be nobody .
T illisâ€™ s anger at her father may be justifiedâ€”he abandoned her as a
child. But this thinking is gettin g in her way . â€œPerhaps nobody else has that
combination of size, skill, quic kness, and vision in the wome nâ€™ s college
game,â€ says Bernstein. â€œY et fe w would rate T illis ahead of the top two
players in the c ountry: Connecticutâ€™ s Diana T aurasi and [Du keâ€™ s Alana]
Beard.â€ T illisâ€™ s performance often fails to match her ability .
Sheâ€™ s fru strated that people have high expectations for her and want her
to play better . â€œI feel like I ha ve to come out and have a t riple-double
[double digits in points scored, rebounds, and assists], dunk the ball over -
the-head 360 [leave your feet, t urn completely around in the air , and slam
the b all into the basket] and maybe people will be like, â€˜Oh, she not that
bad.â€™ â€
I donâ€™ t think people want the impossible. I think they just want to see
her use her won derful talent to t he utmost. I think they want her to develop
the skills she needs to reach her goals.
W orrying about being a nobody is not the mindset that motivates and
sustains champio ns. (Hard as it is, perhaps T illis should admire the fact that
her fath er went for it, instead o f being contemptuous that he didnâ€™ t quite
make it. ) Somebodies are not determined by whether they won or lost.
Somebodies are people who go for it with all they have. If you go for it with
all you have, Iciss T illisâ€”not just in the games, but in practic e tooâ€”you
will already be a somebody .Hereâ€™ s t he other mindset. Itâ€™ s six-foot-three Candace Parker ,  then a
seventeen-year -old senior at Naperville Central High near Chicago, who
was goin g to T ennessee to play for the Lady V ols and their grea t coach, Pat
Summitt.
Candace has a very dif ferent fath er from Iciss, a dad who is teac hing her
a dif ferent lesson: â€œIf you work hard at something, you get out w hat you put
in.â€
Several years before, when he w as coach of her team, her dad lost his
cool with her during a tournament game. She was not going for the
rebounds, she was shooting lazy  shots from the outside instead of using her
height n ear the basket, and she was not exerting herself on def ense. â€œNow
letâ€™ s go out and  try harder!â€ So what happened? She went out and scored
twenty points in the second half , and had ten rebounds. They blew the other
team away . â€œHe lit a fire under me. And I knew he was right.â€
Candace lights the same fire under herself  now . Rather than being
content to be a star , she looks t o improve all the time. When she returned
from knee sur gery , she knew what she needed to work onâ€”her timing,
nerves, a nd wind . When her thre e-point shot went bad, she aske d her father
to come to the gym to work on it with her . â€œWhether it be in basketball or
everyday life,â€ she says, â€œnothing is promised.â€
Only we eks later , the mindset prophecies were already coming true.
T wo thin gs happ ened. One, sadly , is that T illisâ€™ s team was knocked out of
the cham pionship. The other was that Candace Parker became the first
woman ever to win the basketball dunking championshipâ€”against five
men.
Character , heart,  the mind of a c hampion. Itâ€™ s what makes great athletes
and itâ€™ s what c omes from the growth mindset with its focus on self-
development, self-motivation, and responsibility .
Even th ough the finest athletes are wildly competitive and want to be
the b est, greatness does not com e from the ego of the fixed mind set, with its
somebodyâ€“nobody syndrome. Many athletes with the fixed mindset may
have been â€œnaturalsâ€â€”but you k now what? As John W ooden says, we canâ€™ t
remember most of them.
Grow Y our Mindsetâ– 
â– 
â– 
â– Are ther e sports you always ass umed youâ€™re bad at? W ell, maybe
you are, but then maybe you arenâ€™ t. Itâ€™ s not something you can
know un til youâ€™ ve put in a lot of ef fort. Some of the worldâ€™ s best
athletes didnâ€™ t start out being that hot. If you have a passion for a
sport, put in the ef fort and see.
Sometimes being exceptionally endowed is a curse. These athletes
may sta y in a f ixed mindset and not cope well with adversity . Is
there a sport that came easily to you until you hit a wall? T ry on
the growth mindset and go for it again.
â€œCharacterâ€ is an important concept in the sports world, and it
comes out of a growth mindset. Think about times youâ€™ve needed
to re ach deep do wn inside in dif ficult sports matches. Think ab out
the g rowth-mindset champions from this chapter and how they  do
it. What could you do next time to make sure youâ€™re in a growth
mindset in the pinch?
Athletes with a growth mindset find success in learning a nd
improving, not just winning. The more you can do this, the more
rewarding sports will be for youâ€”and for those who play them
with you!Chapter 5
BUSINESS: MINDSET AND LEADERSHIP
ENRON AND THE T ALENT MINDSET
I n 2 001 came the  announcement that shocked the corporate world. Enronâ€”
the corporate poster child, the company of the futureâ€”had gone belly-up.
What h appened? How did such spectacular promise turn into such a
spectacular disaster? W as it incompetence? W as it corruption?
It was mindset. According to M alcolm Gladwell, writing in The New
Y orker ,  American corporations had become obsessed with talent. Indeed, the
gurus at  McKinsey & Company , the premier management consulting firm
in the country , were insisting that corporate success today r equir es  the
â€œtalent mindset.â€  Just as there are naturals in sports, they maintained, there
are naturals in business. Just as sports teams write huge checks to sign
outsized talent, so, too, should corporations spare no expense in recruiting
talent, for this is the secret weapon, the key to beating the competition.
As Gladwell writes, â€œThis â€˜talent mindsetâ€™ is the new orthodoxy of
American manag ement.â€ It created the blueprint for the Enron cultureâ€”and
sowed the seeds of its demise.
Enron recruited big talent, most ly people with fancy degrees, w hich is
not in itself so bad. It paid them  big money , which is not that terrible. But
by putti ng com plete faith in talent, Enron did a fatal thing: It created a
culture that worshiped talent, thereby forcing its employees to look and act
extraordinarily t alented. Basica lly , it forced them into the fixed mindset.
And we know a  lot about that. W e know from our studies that people with
the fixed mindset do not admit and correct their deficiencies.Remember the study where we interviewed students from the University
of Hong Kong, where everythi ng is in English? Students wit h the fixed
mindset were so worried about appearing deficient that they ref used to take
a course that would improve their English. They did not live in a
psychological world where they could take this risk.
And rem ember how we put students into a fixed mindset by praising
their inte lligenceâ€”much as Enr on had done with its star employees? Later ,
after some hard problems, we asked the students to write a letter to
someone in another school describing their experience in our study . When
we read their letters, we were sh ocked: Almost 40 percent of them had lied
about th eir scoresâ€”always in the upward direction. The fixed mindset had
made a flaw intolerable.
Gladwell concl udes that when people live in an environm ent that
esteems them for their innate talent, they have grave dif ficulty  when their
image is  threate ned: â€œThey will not take the remedial course. They will not
stand up to investors and the public and admit that they were wrong. Theyâ€™d
sooner lie.â€
Obviously , a company that cannot self-correct cannot thrive.
If Enron was done in by its fixed  mindset, does it follow that companies
that thrive have a growth mindset? Letâ€™ s see.
ORGANIZA TIONS THA T GROW
Jim Collins set out to discover what made some companies move from
being good to being great. Wha t was it that allowed them to m ake the leap
to greatnessâ€”and stay thereâ€”while other , comparable companies just held
steady at good?
T o a nswer this q uestion, he and his research team embarked on a five-
year study . They selected eleven companies whose stock returns had
skyrocketed relative to other companies in their industry , and who had
maintained this edge for at least fifteen years. They matched each company
to anoth er one in the same indu stry that had similar resources, but did not
make th e leap. He also studied a third group of companies: on es that had
made a leap from good to great but did not sustain it.
What distinguished the thriving companies from the others? There were
several important factors, as Collins reports in his book, Good to Gr eat,  butone that was abs olutely key was the type of leader who in every case  led the
company into greatness. These were not the lar ger -than-life, charismatic
types who oozed ego and self-proclaimed talent. They were self-ef facing
people w ho constantly asked questions and had the ability to confront the
most bru tal answ ersâ€”that is, to look failures in the face, even their own,
while maintaining faith that they would succeed in the end.
Does this sound familiar? Collins wonders why his ef fective leaders
have these particular qualities. And why these qualities go toget her the way
they do.  And how these leaders  came to acquire them. But we know . They
have the growth mindset. They believe in human development. And these
are the hallmarks:
Theyâ€™re not constantly trying to prove theyâ€™re better than others. For
example, they donâ€™ t highlight the pecking order with themselves at the top,
they do nâ€™ t claim credit for oth er peopleâ€™ s contributions, and they donâ€™ t
undermine others to feel powerful.
Instead, they are constantly trying to impr ove.  They surround
themselves with the most able people they can find, they look squarely at
their ow n mistakes and deficiencies, and they ask frankly wha t skills they
and the company will need in the future. And because of this, they can
move fo rward with confidence  thatâ€™ s grounded in the facts, not built on
fantasies about their talent.
Collins reports that Alan W urtzel, the CEO of the giant ele ctronics
chain Circuit City , held debates in his boardroom. Rather than si mply trying
to impre ss his board of directors , he used them to learn. W ith h is executive
team as well, h e questioned, debated, prodded until he slow ly gained a
clearer p icture of where the company was and where it needed t o go. â€œThey
used to call me the prosecutor , because I would hone in on a question,â€
W urtzel told Collins. â€œY ou know , like a bulldog. I wouldnâ€™ t let go until I
understood. Why , why , why?â€
W urtzel considered himself a â€œplow horse,â€ a hardworking, no-
nonsense norma l kind of guy , but he took a company that was close to
bankruptcy and over the next fifteen years turned it into one th at delivered
the highest total return to its stockholders of any firm on the  New Y ork
Stock Exchange.A STUDY OF MINDSET AND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS
Robert W ood and Albert Band ura did a fascinating study wi th graduate
students in business, many of w hom had management experien ce. In their
study , they cr eated  Enr on-type managers and W u rtzel-type managers by
putting people into dif ferent mindsets.
W ood and Bandura gave these budding business leaders a complex
management task in which they had to run a simulated or ganization, a
furniture company . In this computerized task, they had to place employees
in the right jobs and decide how best to guide and motivate the se workers.
T o discover the best ways, they had to keep revising their decisions based
on the feedback they got about employee productivity .
The researchers  divided the business students into two groups. One
group w as give n a fixed minds et. They were told that the task measured
their basic, underlying capabili ties. The higher their capacity , the better
their per formance. The other group was given a growth mindset. They were
told that management skills were developed through practice and that the
task would give them an opportunity to cultivate these skills.
The tas k was hard because students were given high pro duction
standards to meet, andâ€”especially in their early attemptsâ€”they fell short.
As at Enron, those with the fixed mindset did not profit from their mistakes.
But those with t he growth mindset kept on learning. Not worrie d about
measuringâ€”or protectingâ€”their fixed abilities, they looked directly at their
mistakes, used the feedback, and altered their strategies accordingly . They
became better and better at understanding how to deploy a nd moti vate their
workers, and their productivity kept pace. In fact, they ended u p way more
productive than those with the f ixed mindset. Whatâ€™ s more, throughout this
rather grueling task, they maintained a healthy sense of confidence. They
operated like Alan W urtzel.
LEADERSHIP AND THE FIXED MINDSET
In co ntrast to Al an W urtzel, the leaders of Collinsâ€™ s comparison companies
had every symptom of the fixed mindset writ lar ge.
Fixed-mindset l eaders, like fixed-mindset people in general, live in a
world where some people are superior and some are inferior .  They mustrepeatedly af firm that they are superior , and the company is simply a
platform for this.
Collinsâ€™ s comp arison leaders were typically concerned wi th their
â€œreputation for personal greatn essâ€â€”so much so that they o ften set the
company up to f ail when their regime ended. As Collins puts it , â€œAfter all,
what be tter testament to your own personal greatness than th at the place
falls apart after you leave?â€
In more  than two-thirds of these leaders, the researchers saw a
â€œgar gantuan per sonal egoâ€ that either hastened the demise of th e company
or kept it second-rate. Once such leader was Lee Iacocca, head of Chrysler ,
who achieved a miraculous turn around for his company , then spent so much
time grooming his fame that in the second half of his tenure, the company
plunged back into mediocrity .
Many of these c omparison companies operated on what Collin s calls a
â€œgenius with a thousand helpersâ€ model. Instead of b uilding an
extraordinary management team like the good-to-great comp anies, they
operated on the fixed-mindset premise that great geniuses do no t need great
teams. They just need little helpers to carry out their brilliant ideas.
Donâ€™ t for get that these great g eniuses donâ€™ t want  g reat teams, either .
Fixed-mindset p eople want to be the only big fish so that when they
compare themse lves to those a round them, they can feel a cut above the
rest. In not one autobiography of a fixed-mindset CEO did I read much
about mentoring or employee development programs. In every growth-
mindset autobiography , there was d eep concern with personn el
development and extensive discussion of it.
Finally , as with Enron, the geniuses refused to look at their deficiencies.
Says Collins: The good-to-great Kroger grocery chain looked bravely at the
danger signs in the 1970sâ€”signs that the old-fashioned grocery store was
becoming extinct. Meanwhile, its counterpart, A&P , once the lar gest
retailing or ganiz ation in the world, shut its eyes. For example, when A&P
opened a new kind of store, a superstore, and it seemed to be more
successful than the old kind, they closed it down. It was not what they
wanted to hear . I n contrast, Kroger eliminated or changed every  single store
that did not fit the new superstore model and by the end of the 1990s it had
become the number one grocery chain in the country .CEOs and the Big Ego
How did CEO  and gar gantuan ego  become synonymous? If itâ€™ s the more
self-ef facing growth-minded people who are the true shepherds  of industry ,
why are so many companies ou t looking for lar ger -than-life leadersâ€”even
when the se leaders may in the end be more committed to themselves than to
the company?
Blame Iacocca. According to James Surowiecki, writing in Slate,
Iacoccaâ€™ s rise to prominence was a turning point for American business.
Before him, the days of tycoons and moguls seemed long past. In the
publicâ€™ s mind, CEO  me ant â€œa butt oned-down or g anization man, well-
treated and well-paid, but essentially bland and characterless.â€ W ith
Iacocca, all of that changed. Business journalists began dubbing executives
â€œthe next J. P . Mor ganâ€ or â€œthe next Henry Ford.â€ And fix ed-mindset
executives started vying for those labels.
Surowiecki even  traces the recent corporate scandals to this cha nge, for
as th e trend co ntinued, CEOs became superheroes. But the people who
preen th eir egos and look for the next self-image boost are not the same
people who foster long-term corporate health.
Maybe I acocca is just a charism atic guy who, like rock and roll, is being
blamed for the demise of civili zation. Is that fair? Letâ€™ s look at him more
closely . And letâ€™ s look at some o ther fixed-mindset CEOs: Albe rt Dunlap of
Scott Pa per and Sunbeam; Jerry Levin and Steve Case of AOL T ime
W arner; and Kenneth Lay and Jef frey Skilling of Enron.
Y ouâ€™ll s ee they all start with th e belief that some people are superior;
they all have the need to prove and display their  superiority; they all use
their subordinat es to feed this need, rather than fostering the development
of their workers ; and they all end by sacrificing their compa nies to this
need. Th e fixed mindset helps u s understand where gar gantuan egos come
from, how they operate, and why they become self-defeating.
FIXED-MINDSET LEADERS IN ACTION
Iacocca: Iâ€™m a Hero
W arren Bennis, the leadership guru, studied the worldâ€™ s greatest corporate
leaders. These great leaders sai d they didnâ€™ t set out to be lead ers. Theyâ€™dhad no interest in proving themselves. They just did what they lovedâ€”with
tremendous drive and enthusiasmâ€”and it led where it led.
Iacocca wasnâ€™ t like that. Y es, he loved the car business, but more than
anything he yearned to be a muc kamuck at Ford. He craved the approval of
Henry F ord II and the royal tra ppings of of fice. These were the things he
could m easure h imself by , the th ings that would prove he was somebody . I
use the term r oyal  with good reaso n. Iacocca tells us the Glass House, Ford
corporate headquarters, was a palace and Henry Ford was the king. Whatâ€™ s
more, â€œI f Henry was king, I was the crown prince.â€ â€œI was Hi s Majestyâ€™ s
special protÃ©gÃ©.â€ â€œAll of us . . . lived the good life in the royal court. W e
were pa rt of something beyond  first classâ€”royal class. . . . W hite coated
waiters were on call throughout the day , and we all ate lunch together in the
executive dining  room . . . Dov er sole was flown over from England on a
daily basis.â€
Iacocca achieve d great things at Ford, like nurturing and promo ting the
Ford Mustang, and he dreamed of succeeding Henry Ford as the CEO of the
company . But Henry Ford had other ideas and, much to Iacoccaâ€™ s shock and
rage, he eventually forced Iacocca out. Itâ€™ s interesting that Iacocca was
shocked and that he harbored an enduring rage against Henry Ford. After
all, he had seen Henry Ford fire top people, and he, Iacocca, had used the ax
quite liberally on others. He knew the corporate game. Y et his fixed mindset
clouded his vision: â€œI had always clung to the idea that I was dif ferent, that
somehow I was smarter or luckier  than the rest. I didnâ€™ t think it would ever
happen to me.â€ (Italics added.)
His belief in his  inherent superiority had blinded him. Now th e other
side of the fixed mindset kicked in. He wondered whether Henry Ford had
detected a flaw in him. Maybe h e wasnâ€™ t superior after all. And thatâ€™ s why
he could nâ€™ t let go. Y ears later , his second wife told him to get over it. â€œY ou
donâ€™ t rea lize what a favor Henry  Ford did for you. Getting fired from Ford
brought you to greatness. Y ouâ€™re richer , more famous and more influential
because of Henry Ford. Thank him.â€ Shortly thereafter , he divorced her .
So th e k ing who  had defined him  as competent and worthy now rejected
him as flawed.  W ith ferocious ener gy , Iacocca applied himself to the
monumental task of saving face and, in the process, Chrysler Motors.
Chrysler , the once thriving Fo rd rival, was on the brink of death, but
Iacocca as its new CEO acted quickly to hire the right people, bring out newmodels, and lobby the government for bailout loans. Just a few years after
his humiliating  exit from Fo rd, he was able to write a triumphant
autobiography and in it declare, â€œT oday , Iâ€™m a hero.â€
W ithin a  short time, however , C hrysler was in trouble again. Iacoccaâ€™ s
fixed mindset would not stay p ut. He needed to prove his gr eatnessâ€”to
himself, to Henry Ford, to the worldâ€”on a lar ger and lar ger sca le. He spent
his com pany tim e on things tha t would enhance his public im age, and he
spent the companyâ€™ s money on  things that would impress W all Street and
hike up Chrysler â€™ s stock prices.  But he did this instead of inves ting in new
car designs or manufacturing improvements that would keep the company
profitable in the long run.
He also looked to history , to how he would be judged and remembered.
But he did not address this concern by building the company . Quite the
contrary . According to one of his biographers, he worried that his
underlings migh t get credit for successful new designs, so he balked at
approving them. He worried, as Chrysler faltered, that his underlings might
be seen as the ne w saviors, so he  tried to get rid of them. He worried that he
would b e written out of Chrysler history , so he desperately hung on as CEO
long after he had lost his ef fectiveness.
Iacocca had a go lden opportunit y to make a dif ference, to leave a great
legacy . T he American auto industry was facing its biggest challenge ever .
Japanese imports were taking over the American market. It was simple:
They lo oked be tter and they ra n better . Iacoccaâ€™ s own people had done a
detailed study of Honda, and made excellent suggestions to him.
But rath er than taking up the  challenge and delivering better cars,
Iacocca, mired in his fixed mind set, delivered blame and excuses. He went
on the rampage, spewing angry diatribes against the Japanese and
demanding that the American government impose tarif fs and quotas that
would stop them. In an editorial against Iacocca, The New Y ork T imes
scolded, â€œThe solution lies in making better cars in this country , not in
angrier excuses about Japan.â€
Nor was Iacocca growing as a leader of his workforce. In fact,  he was
shrinking into the insulated, petty , and punitive tyrant he had accused Henry
Ford of being. N ot only was he firing people who were critical o f him, heâ€™d
done litt le to reward the workers who had sacrificed so much to save the
company . Even when the money was rolling in, he seemed to have littleinterest in sharing it with them. Their pay remained low and th eir working
conditions remained poor . Y et even when Chrysler was in troub le again, he
maintained a regal lifestyle. T w o million dollars were spent ren ovating his
corporate suite at the W aldorf in New Y ork.
Finally , while there was still time to save Chrysler , the board of
directors eased Iacocca out. They gave him a grand pension, showered him
with sto ck optio ns, and continued many of his corporate perks.  But he was
beside himself with rage, esp ecially since his successor seemed to be
managing the company quite nicely . So in a bid to regain the  throne, he
joined a hostile takeover attempt, one that placed the future of Chrysler at
risk. It failed. But for many , th e suspicion that he put his ego before the
welfare of the company was confirmed.
Iacocca lived the fixed mindset. Although he started out loving  the car
business and having breakthrou gh ideas, his need to prove his superiority
started to dominate, eventuall y killing his enjoyment and stifling his
creativity . As time went on and he became less and less re sponsive to
challenges from competitors, he  resorted to the key weapons of the fixed
mindsetâ€”blame, excuses, and the stifling of critics and rivals.
And as is so ofte n the case with the fixed mindset, because of these very
things, Iacocca lost the validation he craved.
When st udents f ail tests or athle tes lose games, it tells them that theyâ€™ve
dropped the ball. But the powe r that CEOs wield allows them to create a
world that caters night and day to their need for validation. It allows them to
surround themse lves only with the good news of their perfection and the
companyâ€™ s success, no matter what the warning signs may be. This, as you
may recall, is CEO disease and a peril of the fixed mindset.
Y ou kno w , latel y Iâ€™ve wondered whether Iacocca has recuperated from
CEO disease. Heâ€™ s raising money (and giving a lot of his own) for
innovative diabetes research. Heâ€™ s working for the development of
environment-friendly vehicles. Maybe, released from the task of trying to
prove himself, heâ€™ s now going for things he deeply values.
Albert Dunlap: Iâ€™m a Superstar
Albert Dunlap saved dying companies, although Iâ€™m not sure saved  is the
right wo rd. He didnâ€™ t get them ready to thrive in the future. H e got themready to sell for  a profit, for example by firing thousands of w orkers. And
profit he  did. He got a hundred million dollars from the turnarou nd and sale
of Scott Paper . O ne hundred million for little more than a year and a half of
work. â€œDid I earn it? Damn right I did. Iâ€™m a superstar in my field, much
like Michael Jordan in basketball and Bruce Springsteen in rock â€™nâ€™ roll.â€
Iacocca paid lip service to team work, the importance of the little guy ,
and othe r good things. Albert Dunlap didnâ€™ t even pay lip service: â€œIf youâ€™re
in business, youâ€™re in business for one thingâ€”to make money .â€
He p roudly reports an incident at an employee meeting at Scott P aper . A
woman stood up and asked, â€œNow that the company is improving, can we
restart c haritable donations?â€ T o  which he replied, â€œIf you want to give on
your own, that is your business and I encourage you to do it. But this
company is here to make a buck. . . . The answer , in a word, is no.â€
Iâ€™m not here to ar gue that business isnâ€™ t about money , but I do  want to
ask: Why was Dunlap so focused on it?
Letâ€™ s let  him tell us. â€œMaking m y way in the world became a m atter of
self-respect for me, of a kid trying to prove he was worth something. . . . T o
this day , I feel I have to prove and reprove myself.â€ And if he has to prove
himself, he needs a yardstick. Employee satisfaction or community
responsibility or charitable contributions are not good yardsticks. They
cannot be reduced to one nu mber that represents his self-worth. But
shareholder profits can.
In h is own words, â€œThe most ridiculous term heard in boardroom s these
days is â€˜stakeho lders.â€™ â€ The ter m refers to the employees, the community ,
and the other co mpanies, such as suppliers, that the company  deals with.
â€œY ou canâ€™ t measure success by  the interest of multiple stakeh olders. Y ou
can  measure success by how the shareholder fares.â€
The long haul held no interes t for Dunlap. Really learning about a
company and figuring out how t o make it grow didnâ€™ t give him the big blast
of s uperhero juice. â€œEventually , I have gotten bored every place I have
been.â€ In his book, there is a whole chapter called â€œImp ressing the
Analysts,â€ but there is no chapter about making a business work. In other
words, itâ€™ s always about Dunlap proving his genius.
Then in 1996, D unlap took over Sunbeam. In his typical â€œChainsaw Alâ€
style, he closed or sold two-third s of Sunbeamâ€™ s plants and fired half of the
twelve thousand  employees. Ironically , the Sunbeam stock rose  so high, itruined h is plan to sell the company . It was too expensive to buy! Uh-oh,
now he had to run the company . Now he had to keep it profitable, or at least
looking profitab le. But instead o f turning to his staf f or learning what to do,
he inflated revenues, fired peop le who questioned him, and cov ered up the
increasingly dire straits his company was in. Less than two years after the
self-proclaimed superstardom in his book (and one year after an  even more
self-congratulatory revision), Dunlap fell apart and was kicked  out. As he
left, Sunbeam was under inve stigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and was expected to be in technical default on a $1.7 billion
bank loan.
Dunlap deeply misunderstood M ichael Jordan and Bruce Springsteen.
Both of these superstars reached  the pinnacle and stayed there a long time
because they constantly dug down, faced challenges, and kept growing. Al
Dunlap thought that he was inhe rently superior , so he opted out  of the kind
of learning that would have helped him succeed.
The Smartest Guys in the Room
Y es, it seems as though history l ed inevitably from Iacocca to the moguls of
the 1990s, and none more so than Kenneth Lay and Jef frey Skilling, the
leaders of Enron.
Ken Lay , the companyâ€™ s founder , chairman, and CEO, considered
himself a great visionary . According to Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind,
authors of The Sma rtest Guys in the Room,  L ay looked dow n his nose at the
people who actually made the company run, much the way a king might
look at his serfs. He looked dow n on Rich Kinder , the Enron president, who
rolled up his sleeves and tried to make sure the company wou ld reach its
earning tar gets.  Kinder was the man who made Layâ€™ s roy al lifestyle
possible. Kinder was also the on ly person at the top who constantly asked if
they were fooling themselves: â€œAre we smoking our own dope? Are we
drinking our own whiskey?â€
Naturally , his days were numbered. But in his sensible and astute way ,
as he departed he arranged to b uy the one Enron asset that was inherently
valuable, the ener gy pipelinesâ€” the asset that Enron held in disdain. By the
middle of 2003, Kinder â€™ s company had a market value of seven billion
dollars.Even as Lay was  consumed by his view of himself and the regal  manner
in w hich he wi shed to support it, he wanted to be seen as a â€œgood and
thoughtful manâ€ with a credo of respect and integrity . Even as Enron
merrily sucked  the life out of its victims, he wrote to his staf f,
â€œRuthlessness, callousness and arrogance donâ€™ t belong here. . . . W e work
with customers and prospects openly , honestly and sincerely .â€ As with
Iacocca and the others, the perceptionâ€” usually W all Streetâ€™ s perceptio nâ€”
was all-important. The reality less so.
Right th ere with Lay was Jef f Skilling, successor to Rich Kinder as
president and chief operating of ficer , and later the CEO. Skill ing was not
just sm art, he was said to b e â€œthe smartest person I ever metâ€ and
â€œincandescently brilliant.â€ He used his brainpower , however , not to learn
but t o in timidate. When he thought he was smarter than others, which was
almost a lways, he treated them harshly . And anyone who disagreed with
him was just no t bright enough to â€œget it.â€ When a co-CEO with superb
management ski lls was brought in to help Skilling during a hard  time in his
life, Skilling was contemptuo us of him: â€œRon doesnâ€™ t get  it.â€ When
financial analyst s or W all Street  traders tried to press Skilling to go beyond
his p at e xplanations, he treated them as though they were stupid. â€œW ell, itâ€™ s
so obvious. How can you not g et it?â€ In most cases, the W all Street guys,
ever concerned about their own intellect, made believe they got it.
As r esident genius, Skilling had  unlimited faith in his ideas. He had so
much regard for his ideas that he believed Enron should be able  to proclaim
profits as soon as he or his people had the idea that might lead to profits.
This is a radical  extension of the fixed mindset: My genius not only defines
and validates me. It defines and validates the company . It is what cr eates
value. My genius  is pr ofit.  W ow!
And in fact, this  is how Enron came to operate. As McLean and  Elkind
report, Enron recorded â€œmillions of dollars in profits on a business before it
had generated a penny in actual revenues.â€ Of course, after the creative act
no one cared ab out follow-through. That was beneath them. S o, often as
not, the profit never occurred. If genius equaled profit, it didnâ€™ t matter that
Enron people sometimes wasted millions competing against each other .
Said Amanda Martin, an Enron executive, â€œT o put one over on one of your
own was a sign of creativity and greatness.â€Skilling not only thought he was smarter than everyone else but, like
Iacocca, also thought he was lu ckier . According to insiders, he thought he
could b eat the odds. Why should he feel vulnerable? There  was never
anything wrong. Skilling still does not admit that there was anything wrong.
The world simply didnâ€™ t get it.
T wo Geniuses Collide
Resident geniuses almost broug ht down AOL and T ime W arner , too. Steve
Case of AOL a nd Jerry Levin of T ime W arner were two  C EOs with the
fixed mindset who mer ged their companies. Can you see it coming?
Case and  Levin had a lot in com mon. Both of them cultivated an  aura of
supreme intellig ence. Both tried to intimidate people with thei r brilliance.
And both were known to take more credit than they deserved. As resident
geniuses, neither wanted to hear complaints, and both were r eady to fire
people who werenâ€™ t â€œteam playe rs,â€ meaning people who wouldnâ€™ t keep up
the faÃ§ade that they had erected.
When th e mer g er actually took place, AOL was in such debt that the
mer ged compan y was on the brink of ruin. Y ou would think that the two
CEOs might work together , marshaling their resources to save the company
they created. Instead, Levin and Case scrambled for personal power .
Levin w as the first to fall. But C ase was still not trying to make things
work. In  fact, when the new CE O, Richard Parsons, sent someone down to
fix AOL, Case was intensely against it. If someone else f ixed AOL,
someone else would get the credit. As with Iacocca, better to let the
company collapse than let another prince be crowned. When Case was
finally counsele d to resign, he was furious. Like Iacocca, he  denied all
responsibility for the companyâ€™ s problems and vowed to get b ack at those
who had turned against him.
Because of the resident geniuses, AOL T ime W arner ended the year
2002 with a los s of almost one  hundred billion dollars. It was the lar gest
yearly loss in American history .
Invulnerable, Invincible, and EntitledIacocca, Dunlap, Lay and Skilling, Case and Levin. They sho w what can
happen when people with the fixed mindset are put in char ge of companies.
In each case, a brilliant man put his company in jeopar dy because
measuring himself and his legacy outweighed everything else. They were
not evil in the usual sense. They didnâ€™ t set out to do harm. Bu t at critical
decision points, they opted for what would make them feel good and look
good over what would serve the  longer -term corporate goals. Blame others,
cover m istakes, pump up the sto ck prices, crush rivals and critic s, screw the
little guyâ€”these were the standard operating procedures.
What is fascinating is that as they led their companies toward ruin, all of
these leaders felt invulnerable a nd invincible. In many cases, they were in
highly competitive industries, fa cing onslaughts from fierce rivals. But they
lived in a dif ferent reality .
It wa s a world o f personal greatness and entitlement. Kenneth Lay felt a
powerful sense of entitlement. Even as he was getting millions a year in
compensation from Enron, he took lar ge personal loans from the company ,
gave jobs and c ontracts to his relatives, and used the corporate  jets as his
family fleet. Even during bad  years at Chrysler , Iacocca th rew lavish
Christmas parti es for the company elite. At every party , as king, he
presented himse lf with an expensive gift, which the executives were later
billed fo r . Speaking about AOL executives, a former of ficial said, â€œY ouâ€™re
talking about men who thought they had a right to anything.â€
As thes e leaders cloaked themselves in the trappings of royalty ,
surrounded them selves with flatterers who extolled their virtues, and hid
from problems, it is no wonde r they felt invincible. Their fix ed mindset
created a magic realm in which the brilliance and perfection of the king
were constantly validated. W ithin that mindset, they were completely
fulfilled. Why would they want to step outside that realm to face the uglier
reality of warts and failures?
As Mor gan McCall, in his book High Flyers,  poin ts o ut, â€œUn fortunately ,
people often like  t he thin gs that work against their growth. . . . People like
to us e th eir stren gths . . . to achieve quick, dramatic results, even  if . . . they
arenâ€™ t developing the new skills they will need later on. People like to
believe t hey are as good as ever yone says . . . and not take their weaknesses
as serio usly as they might. Pe ople donâ€™ t like to hear bad news or get
criticism. . . . There is tremendous risk . . . in leaving what one does well toattempt to master something new .â€ And the fixed mindset makes it seem all
that much riskier .
Brutal Bosses
McCall goes on to point out that when leaders feel they are inhe rently better
than oth ers, they  may start to believe that the needs or feelings of the lesser
people can be ig nored. None of our fixed-mindset leaders cared much about
the little  guy , and many were outright contemptuous of those beneath them
on the corporat e ladder . Where does this lead? In the guise of â€œkeeping
people on their toes,â€ these bosses may mistreat workers.
Iacocca played painful games with his executives to keep them of f
balance. Jerry Levin of T ime W arner was likened by his colleagues to the
brutal Roman emperor Caligula . Skilling was known for his harsh ridicule
of those less intelligent than he.
Harvey Hornstein, an expert on corporate leadership, writes in his book
Brutal Bosses  tha t this kind of abuse represents the bossesâ€™ desire â€œto
enhance their own feelings of power , competence, and value at the
subordinateâ€™ s ex pense.â€ Do you remember in our studies how people with
the fixe d mindset wanted to co mpare themselves with people who were
worse of f than they were? Th e principle is the same, but there is an
important dif ference: These bosses have the power to make  people worse
of f. And when they do, they feel better about themselves.
Hornstein describes Paul Kazarian, the former CEO of Sunbeam-Oster .
He called himself a â€œperfectioni st,â€ but that was a euphemism for â€œabuser .â€
He thre w things at subordinates when they upset him. On e day , the
comptroller , after displeasing Mr . Kazarian, saw an orange juice container
flying toward him.
Sometimes the victims are pe ople the bosses consider to be less
talented. This can feed their sense of superiority . But often the victims are
the most  competent people, because these are the ones who pose the
greatest threat to a fixed-mindset boss. An engineer at a major aircraft
builder , interviewed by Hornstein, talked about his boss: â€œHis tar gets were
usually those of us who were most competent. I mean, if y ouâ€™re really
concerned abou t our performance, you donâ€™ t pick on those who areperforming best.â€ But if youâ€™re really concerned about your competence,
you do.
When bosses mete out humiliation, a change comes over the place.
Everything starts revolving around pleasing the boss. In Good to Gr eat,
Collins notes that in many of his comparison companies (the ones that
didnâ€™ t go from good to great, o r that went there and declined  again), the
leader became the main thing people worried about. â€œThe minute a leader
allows himself to become the primary reality people worry about, rather
than rea lity bein g the primary r eality , you have a recipe for mediocrity , or
worse.â€
In the 1960s and â€™70s, the Chase Manhattan Bank was ruled by David
Rockefeller , an excessively controlling leader . According to Collins and
Porras in Built to Last,  h is managers lived day to d ay in fear of his
disapproval. At the end of each day , they breathed a sigh of reli ef: â€œWhew!
One mo re day gone and Iâ€™m not in trouble.â€ Even long past his heyday ,
senior managers refused to venture a new idea because â€œDavi d might not
like it.â€ Ray Ma cdonald of Burroughs, Collins and Porras report, publicly
ridiculed manag ers for mistakes to the point where he inhibited  them from
innovating. As a result, even though Burroughs was ahead of IBM in the
early sta ges of the computer industry , the company lost out. The same thing
happened at T exas Instruments, another leader in the exciting e arly days of
the computer . If they didnâ€™ t like a presentation, Mark Shephe rd and Fred
Bucy would yell, bang on tables, insult the speaker , and hurl things. No
wonder their people lost their enterprising spirit.
When bo sses become controllin g and abusive, they put everyone into a
fixed mindset. This means that  instead of learning, growing, and moving
the com pany forward, everyone starts worrying about being judged. It starts
with the bossesâ€™ worry abou t being judged, but it winds  up being
everybodyâ€™ s fear about being judged. Itâ€™ s hard for courage and innovation to
survive a companywide fixed mindset.
GROWTH-MINDSET LEADERS IN ACTION
Andrew Carnegie once said, â€œI wish to have as my epitaph: â€˜Here lies a
man who was w ise enough to bring into his service men who knew more
than he.â€™ â€Okay , letâ€™ s open the windows and let some air in. The fixed mindset
feels so stifling. Even when thos e leaders are globe-trotting and hobnobbing
with world figures, their world seems so small and confiningâ€”because
their minds are always on one thing: V alidate me!
When you enter the world of the growth-mindset leaders, everything
changes. It brightens, it expands, it fills with ener gy , with possibility . Y ou
think, Gee, that seems like fun!  It  has never en tered my mind to lead a
corporation, but when I learned about what these leaders had done, it
sounded like the most exciting thing in the world.
Iâ€™ve cho sen three of these leaders to explore as a contrast to the fixed-
mindset leaders . I chose Jack W elch of General Electric beca use he is a
lar ger -than-life figure with an ego he held in checkâ€”not yo ur straight-
ahead n aturally self-ef facing growth-minded guy . And I chose  Lou Gerst
ner (the man who came in and s aved IBM) and Anne Mulcahy (the woman
who bro ught Xe rox back to lif e) as contrasts to Alfred Dunla p, the other
turnaround expert.
Jack W elch, Lou Gerstner , an d Anne Mulcahy are also fas cinating
because they transformed their companies. They did this by roo ting out the
fixed m indset a nd putting a cu lture of growth and teamwork in its place.
W ith Ge rstner and IBM, itâ€™ s like watching Enron morph into  a growth-
mindset mecca.
As g rowth-mind ed leaders, they start with a belief in human potential
and dev elopmentâ€”both their ow n and other peopleâ€™ s. Instead of using the
company as a ve hicle for their g reatness, they use it as an engine of growth
â€”for themselves, the employees, and the company as a whole.
W arren B ennis h as said that too  many bosses are driven and driving but
going n owhere. Not these people. They donâ€™ t talk royalty . They talk
journey . An inclusive, learning-filled, rollicking journey .
Jack: Listening, Crediting, Nurturing
When Jack W elch took over GE in 1980, the company was valued at
fourteen billion dollars. T wenty years later , it was valued by W all Street at
$490 bi llion. It was the most valuable company in the world. Fortune
magazine called W elch â€œthe most widely admired, studied, and imitatedCEO of his time. . . . His total economic impact is impossible to calculate
but must be a staggering multiple of his GE performance.â€
But to me even more impressive was an op-ed piece in The New Y ork
T imes  b y Steve Benn ett, the CEO of Intuit. â€œI learned about nur turing
employees from  my time at General Electric from Jack W elch. . . . Heâ€™d go
directly to the front-line employee to figure out what was  going on.
Sometime in the early 1990s, I saw him in a factory where  they made
refrigerators in Louisville. . . . He went right to the workers in the assembly
line to hear what they had to sa y . I do frequent CEO chats with front-line
employees. I learned that from Jack.â€
This vig nette sa ys a lot. Jack was obviously a busy guy . An im portant
guy . But he didnâ€™ t run things like Iacoccaâ€”from the luxurious corporate
headquarters where his most frequent contacts were the white-gloved
waiters. W elch never stopped visiting the factories and hearing from the
workers. These were people he respected, learned from, and, in turn,
nurtured.
Then there is the emphasis on teamwork, not the royal I.  Right awayâ€”
right from the â€œDedicationâ€ and the â€œAuthor â€™ s Noteâ€ of W elchâ€™ s
autobiographyâ€”you know something is dif ferent. Itâ€™ s not the â€œ Iâ€™m a heroâ€
of L ee Iacocca or the â€œIâ€™m a superstarâ€ of Alfred Dunlapâ€” although he
could easily lay claim to both.
Instead, itâ€™ s â€œI hate having to use the first person. Nearly everything Iâ€™ve
done in my life  has been accomplished with other people. . . . Please
remember that every time you see the word I  i n these pages, it refers to all
those colleagues and friends and some I might have missed.â€
Or â€œ [These people] filled my jo urney with great fun and learning. They
often made me look better than I am.â€
Already we see the me me me  of the v alidation-hungry CEO becoming
the we  and us  of the growth-minded leader .
Interestingly , before W elch cou ld root the fixed mindset out of the
company , he had to root it out of himself. And believe me, W elch had a
long way to go.  He was not always the leader he learned to b e. In 1971,
W elch w as bein g considered for a promotion when the head of GE human
resources wrote a cautioning memo. He noted that despite W elchâ€™ s many
strengths, the appointment â€œcarries with it more than the usual degree of
risk.â€ He went on to say that W elch was arrogant, couldnâ€™ t take criticism,and depended too much on his talent instead of hard work and his
knowledgeable staf f. Not good signs.
Fortunately , every time his success went to his head, he got a wake-up
call. On e day , young â€œDr .â€ W elc h, decked out in his fancy suit, got into his
new convertible . He proceeded to put the top down and was promptly
squirted with dark, grungy oil that ruined both his suit and the paint job on
his beloved car . â€œThere I was, thinking I was lar ger than life,  and smack
came the reminder that brought me back to reality . It was a great lesson.â€
There is a whol e chapter titled â€œT oo Full of Myselfâ€ about the time he
was on an acqui sition roll and f elt he could do no wrong. Then he bought
Kidder , Peabody , a W all Street investment banking firm with an  Enron-type
culture. It was a disaster that lost hundreds of millions of doll ars for GE.
â€œThe Ki dder ex perience never left me.â€ It taught him that â€œthereâ€™ s only a
razor â€™ s edge between self-confid ence and hubris. This time hub ris won and
taught me a lesson I would never for get.â€
What he  learned was this: T rue self-confidence is â€œthe courag e to be
openâ€”to welcome change and new ideas regardless of their source.â€ Real
self-confidence is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car , or a
series of acquisitions. It is ref lected in your mindset: your r eadiness to
grow .
W ell, humility is a start, but what about the management skills?
From hi s experi ences, W elch learned more and more about the kind of
manager he wanted to be: a grow th-minded managerâ€”a guide, not a judge.
When W elch was a young engineer at GE, he caused a chemical explosion
that blew the roof of f the building he worked in. Emotionally shaken by
what happened , he nervously drove the hundred miles to company
headquarters to face the music a nd explain himself to the boss. But when he
got there , the treatment he rece ived was understanding and supportive. He
never for got it. â€œCharlieâ€™ s reaction made a huge impression on  me. . . . If
weâ€™re m anaging good people who are clearly eating themselves up over an
error , our job is to help them through it.â€
He l earned how to select people : for their mindset, not their pe digrees.
Originally , academic pedigrees impressed him. He hired engineers from
MIT , Princeton, and Caltech. But after a while, he realized that wasnâ€™ t what
counted. â€œEventually I learned that I was really looking for people whowere filled with passion and a desire to get things done. A resume didnâ€™ t tell
me much about that inner hunger .â€
Then ca me a chance to become the CEO. Each of the three candidates
had to convince the reigning CEO he was best for the job. W elch made the
pitch on  the basis of his capaci ty to grow . He didnâ€™ t claim that he was a
genius o r that he was the greatest leader who ever lived. He promised to
develop. He got the job and made good on his promise.
Immediately , he  opened up d ialogue and the channels for honest
feedback. He quickly set to wo rk asking executives what they liked and
disliked about the company and  what they thought needed cha nging. Boy ,
were the y surpri sed. In fact, theyâ€™d been so used to kissing up to the bosses
that they couldnâ€™ t even get their minds around these questions.
Then he spread the word: Thi s company is about growth, not self-
importance.
He shut down e litismâ€”quite the opposite of our fixed-mindset leaders.
One eve ning, W elch addressed an elite executive club at GE that was the
place for movers and shakers to see and be seen. T o their shock, he did not
tell them  how wonderful they w ere. He told them, â€œI canâ€™ t find a ny value in
what youâ€™re doing.â€ Instead, he asked them to think of a role that made
more sense for them and for th e company . A month later , the president of
the club came to W elch with a new idea: to turn the club into a force of
community volunteers. T wenty years later that program, o pen to all
employees, had forty-two thousand members. They were running mentoring
programs in inner -city schools and building parks, playgrounds, and
libraries for communities in nee d. They were now making a contribution to
othersâ€™ growth, not to their own egos.
He g ot rid of brutal bosses. Iacocca tolerated and even admire d brutal
bosses w ho could make the workers produce. It served his bottom line.
W elch admitted that he, too, had often looked the other way . But in the
or ganization he  now envisioned, he could not do that. In fr ont of five
hundred manage rs, â€œI explained why four corporate of ficers were asked to
leave during the prior yearâ€”even though they delivered good financial
performance. . . . [They] were a sked to go because they didnâ€™ t practice our
values.â€ The approved way to foster productivity was no w through
mentoring, not through terror .And he rewarde d teamwork rather than individual genius. For years,
GE, like  Enron , had rewarded the single originator of an idea, but now
W elch wanted to reward the tea m that brought the ideas to fruition. â€œAs a
result, le aders w ere encouraged to share the credit for ideas with their teams
rather than take full credit themselves. It made a huge dif ference in how we
all related to one another .â€
Jack W elch was not a perfect person, but he was devoted to growth.
This devotion kept his ego in ch eck, kept him connected to reality , and kept
him in touch with his humanity . In the end, it made his journey prosperous
and fulfilling for thousands of people.
Lou: Rooting Out the Fixed Mindset
By t he l ate 1980 s, IBM had bec ome Enron, with one exception. The board
of directors knew it was in trouble.
It had a culture of smugness and elitism. W ithin the company , it  was the
old W e ar e r oyalty , but Iâ€™m mor e r o yal than you ar e  syndrome. There was
no te amwork, only turf wars. There were deals but no follow-up. There was
no c oncern for the customer . Y et this probably wouldnâ€™ t have bothered
anyone if business werenâ€™ t suf fering.
In 1993, they tur ned to Lou Ger stner and asked him to be the new CEO.
He said no. They asked him aga in. â€œY ou owe it to America. W eâ€™re going to
have President Clinton call an d tell you to take the job. Ple ase, please,
please. W e want  exactly the kind  of strategy and culture change  you created
at American Express and RJR.â€
In the end he c aved, although he canâ€™ t remember why . But IB M now
had a leader who believed in p ersonal growth and in creating a corporate
culture that would foster it. How did he produce it at IBM?
First, as W elch had done, he opened the channels of communication up
and down the company . Six day s after he arrived, he sent a me mo to every
IBM worker , telling them: â€œOver the next few months, I plan  to visit as
many of  our operations and of fices as I can. And whenever pos sible, I plan
to meet with ma ny of you to talk about how together we can str engthen the
company .â€
He d edicated his book to them: â€œ This book is dedicated to the thousands
of IBMers who never gave up on their company , their colle agues, andthemselves. They are the real heroes of the reinvention of IBM.â€
As W elch had done, he attack ed the elitism. Like Enron, the whole
culture was about grappling for personal status within the company .
Gerstner disbanded the managem ent committee, the ultimate power role for
IBM executives , and often went outside the upper echelons fo r expertise.
From a growth mindset, itâ€™ s not  only the select few that have something to
of fer . â€œH ierarchy means very little to me. Letâ€™ s put together in m eetings the
people who can help solve a problem, regardless of position.â€
Then ca me teamwork. Gerstner fired politicians, those who indulged in
internal intrigue, and instead rewarded people who helped their colleagues.
He stopped IBM sales divisions from putting each other down to clients to
win business for themselves. He started basing executivesâ€™ bonuses more on
IBMâ€™ s overall performance and less on the performance of their individual
units. Th e message: W eâ€™re not looking to crown a few princes; we need to
work as a team.
As a t En ron, the  deal was the glamorous thing; the rest was pe destrian.
Gerstner was appalled by the endless failure to follow through on deals and
decisions, and the companyâ€™ s u nlimited tolerance of it. He dem anded and
inspired better execution. Mess age: Genius is not enough; we need to get
the job done.
Finally , Gerstner focused on the customer . IBM customers felt b etrayed
and angry . IBM was so into itself that it was no longer serving their
computer needs. They were upset about pricing. They were frustrated by the
bureaucracy at IBM. They were irritated that IBM was not helping them to
integrate their systems. At a m eeting of 175 chief information of ficers of
the lar ge st U.S. companies, Gerstner announced that IBM would now put
the customer first and backed it up by announcing a drastic cut in their
mainframe computer prices. M essage: W e are not hereditary royalty; we
serve at the pleasure of our clients.
At the end of his first three arduous months, Gerstner received his report
card from W all Street: â€œ[IBM stock] has done nothing, because he has done
nothing.â€
T icked of f but undaunted, Gerstner continued his anti-royalty campaign
and brought IBM back from its â€œnear -death experience.â€ Th is was the
sprint. This is w hen Dunlap would have taken his money and run. What lay
ahead was the even harder ta sk of maintaining his policies until IBMregained industry leadership. That was the marathon. By the ti me he gave
IBM bac k to the IBMers in March 2002, the stock had increased in value by
800 percent and IBM was â€œnumber one in the world in I T services,
hardware, enterprise software (excluding PCs), and custom-designed, high
performance computer chips.â€ W hatâ€™ s more, IBM was once again defining
the future direction of the industry .
Anne: Learning, T oughness, and Compassion
T ake IBM. Plunge it into debt to the tune of seventeen billion.  Destroy its
credit ra ting. M ake it the tar get  of SEC investigations. And dr op its stock
from $63.69 to $4.43 a share. What do you get? Xerox.
That wa s the Xerox Anne Mulcahy took over in 2000. Not only  had the
company failed to diversify , it could no longer even sell its cop y machines.
But thre e years later , Xerox had had four straight profitable quarters, and in
2004 Fortune  named Mulcahy â€œthe hottest turnaround act since Lou
Gerstner .â€ How did she do it?
She wen t into an incredible learn ing mode, making  herself into the CEO
Xerox n eeded to  survive. She an d her top people, like Ursula Burns, learned
the nitty-gritty of every part of t he business. For example, as Fortune  writer
Betsy Morris explains, Mulcahy took Balance Sheet 101. She learned about
debt, inventory , taxes, and curre ncy so she could predict how each decision
she made would play out on the balance sheet. Every weekend, she took
home lar ge binders and pored o ver them as though her final exam was on
Monday . When she took the helm, people at Xerox units couldnâ€™ t give her
simple a nswers about what they had, what they sold, or who wa s in char ge.
She became a CEO who knew those answers or knew where to get them.
She was  tough. She told everyone the cold, hard truth they did nâ€™ t want
to kn owâ€”like how the Xerox business model was not viable or how close
the c ompany was to running out  of money . She cut the employee rolls by 30
percent. But she was no Chainsaw Al. Instead, she bore the emo tional brunt
of her decisions, roaming the halls, hanging out with the employees, and
saying â€œIâ€™m sorry .â€ She was tough but compassionate. In fact, sheâ€™d wake
up in the middle of the night w orrying about what would happen to the
remaining employees and retirees if the company folded.She wo rried constantly about the morale and development  of her
people, so that e ven with the cuts, she refused to sacrifice the unique and
wonderful parts of the Xerox culture. Xerox was known throughout the
industry as the company that gave retirement parties and hosted retiree
reunions. As the employees stru ggled side by side with her , she refused to
abolish their raises and, in a morale-boosting gesture, gave th em all their
birthdays of f. She wanted to sav e the company in body and  s pir it. A nd not
for herse lf or her ego, but for all  her people who were stretching themselves
to the limit for the company .
After slaving away for two years, Mulcahy opened T ime  magazine only
to see a picture  of herself grouped with the notorious heads of T yco and
W orldCom, men  responsible for two of the biggest corporate management
disasters of our time.
But a year later  she knew her hard work was finally paying of f when
one of her board  members, the f ormer CEO of Procter & Gamb le, told her ,
â€œI n ever thought I would be pr oud to have my name associated with this
company again. I was wrong.â€
Mulcahy was winning the sprint. Next came the marathon. Could Xerox
win that, too? M aybe it had res ted on its laurels too long, resisting change
and lett ing too many chances go by . Or maybe the growth mindsetâ€”
Mulcahyâ€™ s missi on to transform herself and her companyâ€”would help save
another American institution.
Jack, Lou, and Anneâ€”all believing in growth, all brimming with
passion. And all believing that leadership is about growth and passion, not
about brilliance . The fixed-mindset leaders were, in the end, full of
bitterness, but the growth-minded leaders were full of gratitude. They
looked up with gratitude to th eir workers who had made their amazing
journey possible. They called them the real heroes.
Are  CEO and  Male Synonymous?
When y ou look at the books written by and about CEOs, you would think
so. J im Collinsâ€™ s good-to-great leaders (and his comparison to not-so-great
leaders) were all men. Perhaps thatâ€™ s because men are the ones w hoâ€™ve been
at the top for a long while.A few years ago, youâ€™d have b een hard-pressed to think of w omen at
the top of big companies. In fact, many women whoâ€™ve run big companies
had to create th em, like Mary Kay Ash (the cosmetics tycoon), Martha
Stewart, or Oprah W infrey . Or inherit them, like Katharine Graham, the
former head of The W ashington Post.
Things are beginning to change . W omen now hold more key positions
in b ig business. Theyâ€™ve been the CEOs of not only Xerox, but also eBay ,
Hewlett-Packard, V iacomâ€™ s MTV Networks, T ime W arner â€™ s T ime, Inc.,
Lucent T echnologies, and Rite Aid. W omen have been the presidents or
chief fin ancial of ficers of Citigroup, PepsiCo, and V erizon. In fact, Fortune
magazine called  Meg Whitman of eBay â€œmaybe . . . the b est CEO in
Americaâ€ of the â€œworldâ€™ s hottest company .â€
I w onder whether , in a few years , Iâ€™ll be able to write this whole chapter
with wo men as the main charac ters. On the other hand, I hope not. I hope
that in a few ye ars, it will be hard to find fixed-mindset leade rsâ€”men or
womenâ€”at the top of our most important companies.
A STUDY OF GROUP PROCESSES
Researcher Robert W ood and his colleagues did another great study . This
time they created management gr oups,  t hir ty gr oups wi th three people each.
Half of the groups had three peo ple with a fixed mindset and half had three
people with a growth mindset.
Those with the f ixed mindset believed that: â€œPeople have a certain fixed
amount of management ability and they cannot do much to change it.â€ In
contrast, those with the growth mindset believed: â€œPeople can always
substantially change their basic  skills for managing other people.â€ So one
group th ought th at you have it or you donâ€™ t; the other thought your skills
could grow with experience.
Every group had worked toge ther for some weeks when th ey were
given, jo intly , th e task I talked about before: a complex managem ent task in
which they ran a simulated o r ganization, a furniture comp any . If you
remember , on this task people h ad to figure out how to match workers with
jobs and  how to motivate them  for maximum productivity . But this time,
instead of working individually ,  people could discuss their cho ices and the
feedback they got, and work together to improve their decisions.The fixe d- and growth-mindset groups started with the same ability , but
as time went on  the growth-mindset groups clearly outperformed the fixed-
mindset ones. And this dif ference became ever lar ger the longe r the groups
worked. Once again, those wit h the growth mindset profited from their
mistakes and feedback far more than the fixed-mindset people. But what
was even more interesting was how the groups functioned.
The mem bers of the growth-mindset groups were much more likely to
state their honest opinions and openly express their disagreements as they
communicated about their mana gement decisions. Everyone was part of the
learning process. For the fixed-mindset groupsâ€”with their concern about
who was  smart or dumb or their  anxiety about disapproval for t heir ideasâ€”
that ope n, productive discussion did not happen. Instead, it wa s more like
groupthink.
GROUPTHINK VERSUS WE THINK
In th e early 1970s, Irving Janis popularized the term gr oupthink.  Itâ€™ s when
everyone in a group starts think ing alike. No one disagrees. No  one takes a
critical stance. It can lead to catastrophic decisions, and, as the W ood study
suggests, it often can come right out of a fixed mindset.
Groupthink can occur when people put unlimited faith in a talented
leader , a  genius. This is what led to the disastrous Bay of Pig s invasion,
Americaâ€™ s half- baked secret plan to invade Cuba and top ple Castro.
President Kenne dyâ€™ s normally astute advisers suspended thei r judgment.
Why? B ecause they thought he was golden and everything he did was
bound to succeed.
According to Arthur Schlesinge r , an insider , the men around Kennedy
had unb ounded faith in his ability and luck. â€œEverything had broken right
for him since 1956. He had won the nomination and the election  against all
the o dds in the book. Everyone around him thought he had the Midas touch
and could not lose.â€
Schlesinger also said, â€œHad one senior advisor opposed the adventure, I
believe t hat Ken nedy would have canceled it. No one spoke against it.â€ T o
prevent this from happening to him, W inston Churchill set u p a special
department. Others might be in awe of his titanic persona, but the job of this
department, Jim Collins reports, was to give Churchill all the worst news.Then Churchill could sleep well at night, knowing he had not been
groupthinked into a false sense of security .
Groupthink can  happen when the group gets carried away with its
brilliance and superiority . At Enron, the executives believed that because
they we re brillia nt, all of their ideas were brilliant. Nothing wo uld ever go
wrong. An outside consultant k ept asking Enron people, â€œWhere do you
think youâ€™re vulnerable?â€ Nobody answered him. Nobody even understood
the question. â€œW e got to the poin t,â€ said a top executive, â€œwhere  we thought
we were bullet proof.â€
Alfred P . Sloan, the former CE O of General Motors, presents a nice
contrast. He was leading a group of high-level policy makers who seemed
to ha ve reached a consensus. â€œG entlemen,â€ he said, â€œI take it we are all in
complete agreement on the decision here. . . . Then I propose we postpone
further discussion of this matter until our next meeting to give ourselves
time to develop disagreement an d perhaps gain some understanding of what
the decision is all about.â€
Herodotus, writing in the fifth century b.c., reported that the ancient
Persians used a version of S loanâ€™ s techniques to prevent groupthink.
Whenever a group reached a dec ision while sober , they later rec onsidered it
while intoxicated.
Groupthink can also happen when a fixed-mindset leader punishes
dissent. People may not stop th inking critically , but they stop s peaking up.
Iacocca tried to silence (or get rid of) people who were critical of his ideas
and dec isions. He said the new , rounder cars looked like flying potatoes,
and that was the end of it. No one was allowed to dif fer , as Chrysler and its
square cars lost more and more of the market share.
David P ackard, on the other hand, gave an employee a medal for
defying him. The co-founder of  Hewlett-Packard tells this story . Y ears ago
at a Hew lett-Packard lab, they t old a young engineer to give up work on a
display monitor he was developing. In response, he went â€œon vacation,â€
touring California and dropping  in on potential customers to show them the
monitor and gauge their intere st. The customers loved it, h e continued
working on it, and then he somehow persuaded his manager to  put it into
production. The  company sold more than seventeen thousand of his
monitors and reaped a sales revenue of thirty-five million dollar s. Later , at a
meeting of Hewlett-Packard engineers, Packard gave the young man amedal â€œfor extraordinary contempt and defiance beyond the normal call of
engineering duty .â€
There are so many ways the fixed mindset creates groupthink. Leaders
are seen as gods who never err . A group invests itself with special talents
and powers. Leaders, to bolster their ego, suppress dissent. Or workers,
seeking validatio n from leaders, fall into line behind them. Tha tâ€™ s why itâ€™ s
critical t o be in a growth minds et when important decisions are made. As
Robert W ood showed in his stu dy , a growth mindsetâ€”by relieving people
of the illusions or the burdens of fixed abilityâ€”leads to a fu ll and open
discussion of the information and to enhanced decision making.
THE PRAISED GENERA TION HITS THE WORKFORCE
Are we going to  have a problem finding leaders in the future ? Y ou canâ€™ t
pick up a magazine or turn on the radio without hearing about the problem
of praise in the workplace. W e could have seen it coming.
W eâ€™ve t alked about all the well -meaning parents whoâ€™ve tried to boost
their childrenâ€™ s self-esteem by te lling them how smart and talent ed they are.
And weâ€™ve talked about all the negative ef fects of this kind of p raise. W ell,
these children of praise have no w entered the workforce, and sure enough,
many canâ€™ t function without get ting a sticker for their every move. Instead
of yearl y bonuses, some companies are giving quarterly or even monthly
bonuses. Instead  of employee o f the month, itâ€™ s the employee  of the day .
Companies are calling in cons ultants to teach them how best to lavish
rewards on this overpraised generation. W e now have a workforce full of
people who need constant reassurance and canâ€™ t take criticism. N ot a recipe
for succ ess in business, where taking on challenges, showing persistence,
and admitting and correcting mistakes are essential.
Why are businesses perpetuating  the problem? Why are they continuing
the same misguided practices of the overpraising parents, and paying
money to consultants to show them how to do it? Maybe we need to step
back from this problem and take another perspective.
If the wrong kinds of praise lead kids down the path of entitlement,
dependence, and fragility , maybe the right kinds of praise can  lead them
down th e path of hard work and greater hardiness. W e have shown in ourresearch that with the right kinds of feedback even adults can be motivated
to choose challenging tasks and confront their mistakes.
What would this feedback look or sound like in the workplace? Instead
of just giving employees an award for the smartest idea or praise for a
brilliant performance, they would get praise for taking initiative, for seeing
a dif ficult task through, for struggling and learning something new , for
being un daunted by a setback, o r for being open to and acting o n criticism.
Maybe it could be praise for not needing constant praise!
Through a skewed sense of how to love their children, many pa rents in
the â€™90s  (and, unfortunately , many parents of the â€™00s) abdicated their
responsibility . Although corporations are not usually in the business of
picking up where parents left of f, they may need to this time. I f businesses
donâ€™ t p lay a role in develop ing a more mature and growth-minded
workforce, where will the leaders of the future come from?
ARE NEGOTIA T ORS BORN OR MADE?
One of the key t hings that the successful businessperson must b e good at is
negotiation. In fact, itâ€™ s hard to imagine how a business could thrive without
skilled negotiators at the helm. Laura Kray and Michael Haselhuhn have
shown that mindsets have an im portant impact on negotiation  success. In
one study , they taught people either a fixed or a growth mindset about
negotiation skills. Half of the participants read an article called
â€œNegotiation Ab ility , Like Plaster , Is Pretty Stable Over T ime.â€ The other
half read one called â€œNegotia tion Ability Is Changeable and Can Be
Developed.â€ T o give you a flavor for the articles, the growth mindset article
started by saying, â€œWhile it used to be believed that negotiating was a fixed
skill tha t people  were either born with or not, experts in the field now
believe that negotiating is a d ynamic skill that can be cultivated and
developed over a lifetime.â€
The participants were then asked to select the kind of negotiation task
they wanted. They could choose one that showed of f their negotiation skills,
although they would not learn anything new . Or they could choose one in
which they might make mistak es and get confused, but they would learn
some useful negotiation skills. Almost half (47 percent) of the people who
were tau ght the fixed mindset a bout negotiation skills chose the task thatsimply s howed of f their skills, b ut only 12 percent of those who were taught
the g rowth mindset cared to pursue this showof fy task. This means that 88
percent of the p eople who learned a growth mindset wanted to dig into the
task that would improve their negotiation skills.
In t heir next st udy , Kray and Haselhuhn monitored people as they
engaged in negotiations. Again, half of the people were given a fixed
mindset about negotiation skills and the other half were given a growth
mindset. The people, two at a ti me, engaged in an employment negotiation.
In each pair , o ne person was the job candidate and the other was the
recruiter , and they negotiated o n eight issues, including salary , vacation
time, an d benef its. By the end  of the negotiation, those with  the growth
mindset were the clear winners , doing almost twice as well as those with
the fixed mindset. The people who had learned the growth mindset
persevered through the rough spots and stalemates to gain more favorable
outcomes.
In th ree final stu dies, the researchers looked at MBA students enrolled
in a course on negotiation. Here they measured the mindsets the MBA
students already  had, asking them how much they agreed with fixed
mindset stateme nts (â€œThe kind o f negotiator someone is is very basic and it
canâ€™ t be changed very much,â€ â€œGood negotiators are born tha t wayâ€) and
growth m indset statements (â€œA ll people can change even their most basic
negotiation qualities,â€ â€œIn negotiations, experience is a great teacherâ€).
Similar to before, they found th at the more of a growth mindset the student
had, the better he or she did on the negotiation task.
But doe s a growth mindset make people good just at getting th eir own
way? Of ten negotiations require people to understand and try to serve the
other pe rsonâ€™ s i nterests as well. Ideally , at the end of a negot iation, both
parties feel their needs have bee n met. In a study with a more challenging
negotiation task, those with a growth mindset were able to get beyond
initial failures by constructing a deal that addressed both  partiesâ€™ underlying
interests. So, not only do those with a growth mindset gain mo re lucrative
outcomes for themselves, but, more important, they also come up with more
creative solutions that confer benefits all around.
Finally , a growth mindset promoted greater learning. Those MBA
students who endorsed a growth  mindset on the first day of the  negotiation
course earned higher final grades in the course weeks later . This grade wasbased on performance on written assignments, in class discussions, and
during class presentations, and reflected a deeper comprehension of
negotiation theory and practice.
CORPORA TE TRAINING: ARE MANAGERS BORN OR MADE?
Millions of dollars and thousan ds of hours are spent each year trying to
teach le aders and managers how to coach their employees and give them
ef fective feedback. Y et much of this training is inef fective, and many
leaders and managers remain poor coaches. Is that because this canâ€™ t be
trained? No, thatâ€™ s not the reas on. Research sheds light on why corporate
training often fails.
Studies by Peter Heslin, Don V andeW alle, and Gary Latham show that
many m anagers do not believe in personal change. These fix ed-mindset
managers simply look for existing talentâ€”they judge employees as
competent or incompetent at the start and thatâ€™ s that. They do relatively
little dev elopmental coaching a nd when employees do  improv e, they may
fail to take notic e, remaining stuck in their initial impression. W hatâ€™ s more
(like managers at Enron), they are far less likely to seek or accept critical
feedback from their employees . Why bother to coach employees if they
canâ€™ t change and why get feedback from them if you canâ€™ t change?
Managers with a growth mindset think itâ€™ s nice to have talent, but thatâ€™ s
just the  starting point. These managers are more committed to their
employeesâ€™ dev elopment, and to their own. They give a great deal more
developmental coaching, they notice improvement in employeesâ€™
performance, and they welcome critiques from their employees.
Most exciting, the growth mind set can be taught to managers . Heslin
and his colleagues conducted a  brief workshop based on well-established
psychological pr inciples. (By the way , with a few changes, it c ould just as
easily be used to promote a growth mindset in teachers or coaches.) The
workshop starts of f with a video and a scientific article about how the brain
changes with learning. As with  our â€œBrainologyâ€ workshop (described in
chapter 8 ), itâ€™ s always compelling for people to understand how dynam ic
the brain  is and how it changes  with learning. The article goe s on to talk
about how change is possible throughout life and how people can develop
their abilities at most tasks with coaching and practice. Although managers,â– 
â– 
â– 
â– of course, want to find the right person for a job, the exactly right person
doesnâ€™ t always come along. H owever , training and experience can often
draw out and develop the qualities required for successful performance.
The workshop then takes man agers through a series of exer cises in
which a) they consider why itâ€™ s important to understand that people can
develop their abilities, b) they think of areas in which they on ce had low
ability b ut now perform well, c) they write to a struggling pr otÃ©gÃ© about
how his or her abilities can be d eveloped, and d) they recall times they have
seen people learn to do things th ey never thought these people c ould do. In
each case, they reflect upon why and how change takes place.
After th e workshop, there was a rapid change in how readily the
participating ma nagers detected  improvement in employee performance, in
how willing they were to coach a poor performer , and in the quantity and
quality o f their coaching sugges tions. Whatâ€™ s more, these changes persisted
over the six-week period in which they were followed up.
What do es this mean? First, it m eans that our best bet is not si mply to
hire the most talented manager s we can find and turn them lo ose, but to
look for managers who also embody a growth mindset: a zest for teaching
and lear ning, an  openness to giv ing and receiving feedback, and an ability
to confront and surmount obstacles.
It also means w e need to train leaders, managers, and employees to
believe in growth, in addition to training them in the specifics of ef fective
communication and mentoring. Indeed, a growth mindset workshop might
be a good first step in any major training program.
Finally , it means creating a growth-mindset environment in which
people can thrive. This involves:
Presenting skills as learnable
Conveying that the or ganization values learning and
perseverance, not just ready-made genius or talent
Giving feedback in a way that promotes learning and future
success
Presenting managers as resources for learning
W ithout a belief in human development, many corporate training
programs become exercises of limited value. W ith a belief in development,such pro grams g ive meaning to the term â€œhuman resourcesâ€ and become a
means of tapping enormous potential.
ARE LEADERS BORN OR MADE?
When W arren Bennis interviewed great leaders, â€œThey all agreed leaders
are mad e, not born, and made more by themselves than by a ny external
means.â€ Bennis concurred: â€œI believe . . . that everyone, of whatever age
and circumstance, is capable of self-transformation.â€ Not that everyone will
become a leader . Sadly , most managers and even CEOs become bosses, not
leaders. They wield power instead of transforming themselves, their
workers, and their or ganization.
Why is this? John Zenger and Joseph Folkman point out that most
people, when they first become managers, enter a period of great learning.
They get lots of training and coaching, they are open to idea s, and they
think long and hard about how to do their jobs. They are  looking to
develop. But once theyâ€™ve learned the basics, they stop trying to improve. It
may seem like too much trouble, or they may not see where improvement
will take them. They are content to do their jobs rather th an making
themselves into leaders.
Or , as Mor gan McCall ar gues,  many or ganizations believe in natural
talent and donâ€™ t look for people with the potential  to develop. Not only are
these or ganizations missing out on a big pool of possible leaders, but their
belief in natural talent might actually squash the very people they think are
the n aturals, making them into arrogant, defensive nonlearners. The lesson
is: C reate an or g anization that prizes the development of abilityâ€”and watch
the leaders emer ge.
ORGANIZA TIONAL MINDSETS
When we talked about Lou Gers tner and Anne Mulcahy , we saw  the kind of
company they wanted to createâ€”and did create. These were companies that
embraced the development of all employees and not the worship of a
handful of anointed â€œgeniuses.â€ This raised a question.
Clearly the leader of an or ga nization can hold a fixed or growth
mindset, but can an or ganization  as a whole have a mindset? Can it have apervasive belief that talent is just fixed or , instead, a pervasive belief that
talent can and should be developed in all employees? And, if so, what
impact will this have on the or ganization and its employees? T o find out, we
studied a group of lar ge corporations consisting of Fortune  500 and Fortune
1000 companies.
An or ganization might embody a fixed mindset, conveying that
employees eithe r â€œhave itâ€ or they donâ€™ t: W e called this a â€œculture of
genius.â€ Or it m ight embody more of a growth mindset, conveying that
people can grow and improve with ef fort, good strategies, and good
mentoring: W e call this a â€œculture of development.â€
T o dete rmine a companyâ€™ s mindset, we asked a diverse sample of
employees at each or ganization how much they agreed with statements like
these: When it  comes to being succes sful, this company seems to believe
that people have a certain amount of talent, and they canâ€™ t r eally do much
to change it  ( fix ed m indset). This company values natural in telligence and
business talent mor e than any other characteristics  (a lso fixed mindset).
This company genuinely values the personal development and g r owth of its
employees  (growth mindset).
W e then compiled the responses and they revealed something important:
There w as a strong consensus within each company about whether the
company had fixed- or growth- mindset beliefs and values. W e were now
ready to  examine the impact of the companyâ€™ s mindsetâ€”on employeesâ€™
trust in the comp any , on their se nse of empowerment and commitment, and
on t he level of  collaboration, innovation, and ethical behavi or that was
embraced in the or ganization.
What w e found was fascinating. People who work in growth- mindset
or ganizations have far more trust in their company and a much greater sense
of empowerme nt, ownership, and commitment. For exam ple, when
employees were asked to rate statements such as â€œPeople ar e trustworthy in
this or ganization,â€  th ose in growth -mindset compa nies expressed far higher
agreement. Right in line with th is, employees in growth-mindset companies
also reported that they were mu ch more committed to their co mpany and
more willing to go the extra mil e for it: â€œI feel a str ong sense of ownership
and commitment to the futur e of this company .â€  Those who worked in
fixed-mindset c ompanies, howe ver , expressed greater interest in leaving
their company for another .Itâ€™ s nice that employees in growth-mindset or ganizations feel trusting
and committed, but what about  agility and innovation? Thatâ€™ s something
that or ganizations should and do care greatly about these days . Perhaps a
company has to sacrifice some comfort and loyalty to be on the leading
edge. Perhaps a belief in fixed talent motivates innovation.
It doesnâ€™ t look that way .
Itâ€™ s actually the employees in t he growth-mindset companies who say
that their or ganization supports  (reasonable) risk-taking, inno vation, and
creativity . For example, they agreed far  more strongly w ith statements like
this: â€œThis company genuinely supports risk-taking and will support me
even if I failâ€  and â€œPeople ar e encouraged to be innovative in this company
â€”cr eativity is welcomed.â€
Employees in the fixed-mindset companies not only say that their
companies are less likely to su pport them in risk-taking and innovation,
they are  also far more likely to agree that their or ganizations are rife with
cutthroat or unethical behavior: â€œIn this company there is a lot of cheating,
taking shortcuts,  and cutting cor nersâ€ or â€œIn this company peopl e often hide
information and keep secrets.â€ It makes a lot of sense when you think about
it. W hen or ganizations put the premium on natural talent, then everyone
wants to  be the superstar , everyone wants to shine brighter than the others,
and people may be more likely to cheat or cut corners to do so. T eamwork
can take a nosedive.
So, employees in growth-mindset companies have more positive views
of their  or ganizations, but is that admiration reciprocated? Y es, it is.
Supervisors in growth-mindset companies had significantly m ore positive
views of their employeesâ€”and on dimensions companies should care
about. Supervisors in growth-mindset companies rated their employees as
more collaborat ive and more committed to learning and growing. And as
more innovative. And as having far greater management potential. These
are all things tha t make a compa ny more agile and more likely to stay in the
vanguard.
I l ove this last f inding: Supervi sors in growth-mindset compan ies saw
their team members as having far greater management potential than did
supervisors in fixed-mindset co mpanies. They saw future leaders in the
making. I love the irony . The fixed-mindset companies presumably
searched for the talent, hired the talent, and rewarded the talentâ€”but nowâ– 
â– 
â– they we re looking around and saying, â€œWhereâ€™ s the talent?â€ The talent
wasnâ€™ t flourishing.
Our findings tell us that itâ€™ s poss ible to weave a fixed or growth mindset
into the very fa bric of an or ga nization to create a culture of genius or a
culture of development. Everyb ody knows that the business m odels of the
past are no lon ger valid and that modern companies must constantly
reinvent themselves to stay alive. Which companies do you think have a
better chance of thriving in todayâ€™ s world?
Grow Y our Mindset
Are you  in a fixed-mindset or growth-mindset workplace? Do y ou
feel people are just judging you  or are they helping you develop?
Maybe you could try making it a more growth-mindset pla ce,
starting with yourself. Are there ways you could be less defensive
about your mistakes? Could you profit more from the feedback you
get? Are there w ays you can create more learning experiences for
yourself?
How do you  act tow ard othe rs in your workplace? Are you a fixed-
mindset boss, focused on your power more than on your
employeesâ€™ well-being? Do you ever reaf firm your status by
demeaning others? Do you ever try to hold back high-performing
employees because they threaten you?
Consider ways to help your e mployees develop on the job:
Apprenticeships? W orkshops? Coaching sessions? Think about
how yo u can start seeing and treating your employees as your
collaborators, as a team. Make a list of strategies and try them out.
Do this even if you already thin k of yourself as a growth-mindset
boss. W ell-placed support and growth-promoting feedback never
hurt.
If you run a company , look at it from a mindset perspective. Does
it need you to d o a Lou Gerstne r on it? Think seriously about how
to ro ot out elitis m and create a culture of self-examination, op en
communication, and teamwork. Read Gerst ner â€™ s excellent bo ok
Who Says Elephants Canâ€™ t Dance?  to see how itâ€™ s done.â– Is yo ur workplace set up to pro mote groupthink? If so, the whole
decision-making process is in trouble. Create ways to foster
alternative views and constructive criticism. Assign people to play
the devilâ€™ s advocate, taking opposing viewpoints so you can see the
holes in  your position. Get pe ople to wage debates that ar g ue
dif ferent sides of the issue. Ha ve an anonymous suggestion box
that employees must contribute  to as part of the decision-making
process. Remember , people can be independent thinkers and team
players at the same time. Help them fill both roles.Chapter 6
RELA TIONSHIPS: MINDSETS IN LOVE (OR NOT)
W hat w as that abo ut the course of  true love never running smoot h? W ell,
the course to  t rue  lov e isnâ€™ t so smooth, either . That path is often strewn with
disappointments and heartbreaks. Some people let these experiences scar
them and prevent them from forming satisfying relationships in the future.
Others are able to heal and mov e on. What separates them? T o find out, we
recruited more than a hundred people and asked them to tell us about a
terrible rejection.
When I first got to New Y ork I was incredibly lonely . I didnâ€™ t k now
a s oul and I totally felt like I didnâ€™ t belong here. After about a year
of miser y I met Jack. Itâ€™ s almo st an understatement to say tha t we
clicked instantly , we felt like w e had known each other foreve r . It
wasnâ€™ t long before we were liv ing together and doing everything
together . I thought I would spend my whole life with him an d he
said he felt the s ame way . T wo really happy years passed. Then  one
day I came home and found a n ote. He said he had to leave, d onâ€™ t
try to find him. He didnâ€™ t even sign it love. I never heard from him
again. Sometimes when the phone rings I still think maybe itâ€™ s him.
W e heard a variation of that story over and over again. People w ith both
mindsets told stories like this. Almost everyone, at one time or another , had
been in love and  had been hurt. What dif feredâ€”and dif fered dra maticallyâ€”
was how they dealt with it.
After they told t heir stories, we asked them follow-up questions: What
did this mean to you? How did you handle it? What were you hoping for?When pe ople ha d the fixed mind set, they felt judged and labele d by the
rejection. Permanently labeled. It was as though a verdict had been handed
down and branded on their foreheads: unlovable! And they lashed out.
Because the fixed mindset gives them no recipe for healing their wound,
all they could do  was hope to wound the person who inflicted i t. L ydia, the
woman in the st ory above, told us that she had lasting, intense feelings of
bitterness: â€œI would get back at him, hurt him any way I could if I got the
chance. He deserves it.â€
In fa ct, for peop le with the fixe d mindset, their number one go al came
through loud and clear . Revenge. As one man put it, â€œShe too k my worth
with her when she left. Not a day goes by I donâ€™ t think about how to make
her pay .â€ During the study , I asked one of my fixed-mindset friends about
her divorce. Iâ€™ll never for get what she said. â€œIf I had to choose between me
being ha ppy and  him being mi serable, I would definitely want him to be
miserable.â€
It had to be a person with the fixed mindset who coined the  phrase
â€œRevenge is sweetâ€â€”the idea that with revenge comes your redemptionâ€”
because people with the growth  mindset have little taste for it. The stories
they told were every bit as wr enching, but their reactions couldnâ€™ t have
been more dif ferent.
For them, it was about understanding, for giving, and moving on.
Although they were often deep ly hurt by what happened, they wanted to
learn from it: â€œThat relationship and how it ended really taught me the
importance of communicating. I used to think love conquers all, but now I
know it needs a lot of help.â€ This same man went on to say , â€œI also learned
something about whoâ€™ s right for me. I guess every relationship teaches you
more about whoâ€™ s right for you.â€
There is a Frenc h expression: â€œT out compr endr e câ€™est tout par donner .â€
T o u nderstand all is to for give a ll. Of course, this can be carried too far , but
itâ€™ s a good place to start. For pe ople with the growth mindset, the number
one goal  was for giveness. As on e woman said: â€œIâ€™m no saint, but I knew for
my own peace of mind that I had  to for give and for get. He hurt me but I had
a whole life waiting for me and Iâ€™ll be damned if I was going to live it in the
past. One day I just said, â€˜Good luck to him and good luck to me.â€™ â€
Because of their growth mindset, they did not feel permanently branded.
Because of it, t hey tried to learn something useful about them selves andrelationships, something they could use toward having a better experience
in the future. And they knew how to move on and embrace that future.
My cousin Cathy embodies the g rowth mindset. Several years ago, after
twenty-three years of marriage, her husband left her . Then, to add insult to
injury , s he was in an accident a nd hurt her leg. There she sat, home alone
one Saturday night, when she said to herself, â€œIâ€™ll be damned if Iâ€™m going
to sit here and feel sorry for m yself!â€ (Perhaps this phrase should be the
mantra of the gr owth mindset.) Out she went to a dance (leg and all) where
she met her future husband.
The Con tos fam ily had pulled o ut all the stops. Nicole Contos , in her
exquisite wedding dress, arriv ed at the church in a Rolls-Royce. The
archbishop was inside waiting to perform the ceremony , and hundreds of
friends a nd relat ives from all ov er the world were in attendance. Everything
was perf ect unti l the best man went over to Nicole and told her the news.
The groom would not be coming. Can you imagine the shock, the pain?
The family , thinking of the hundreds of guests, decided to go through
with the reception and dinner . T hen, rallying around Nicole, they asked her
what she  wanted to do. In an ac t of great courage, she changed into a little
black dr ess, wen t to the party , and danced solo to â€œI W ill Survive.â€ It was
not the dance she had anticipated, but it was one that made her an icon of
gutsiness in the national press the next day . Nicole was like the football
player w ho ran the wrong way . Here was an event that could have defined
and diminished her . Instead it was one that enlar ged her .
Itâ€™ s inter esting. Nicole spoke repeatedly about the pain and trauma of
being st ood up at her wedding, but she never used the word humiliated.  If
she had judged herself, felt flawed and unworthyâ€”humiliatedâ€”she would
have run and hidden. Instead, her good clean pain made her able to
surround herself  with the love of her friends and relatives and begin the
healing process.
What, by the wa y , had happened to the groom? As it turned out, he had
gone on  the honeymoon, flying of f to T ahiti on his own. What happened to
Nicole? A couple of years later , in the same wedding dress an d the same
church, she married a great guy . W as she scared? No, she says: â€œI knew he
was going to be there.â€
When you think about how reje ction wounds and inflames people with
the fixed mindset, it will com e as no surprise that kids with the fixedmindset are the ones who react to taunting and bullying with thoughts of
violent retaliation. Iâ€™ll return to this later .
RELA TIONSHIPS ARE DIFFERENT
In h is study of gifted people, Benjamin Bloom included concert pianists,
sculptors, Olympic swimmers, t ennis players, mathematicians, a nd research
neurologists. But not people who were gifted in interpersonal re lationships.
He planned to. After all, there are so many professions in which
interpersonal ski lls play a key roleâ€”teachers, psychologists, adm inistrators,
diplomats. But no matter how hard Bloom tried, he couldnâ€™ t find any
agreed-upon way of measuring social ability .
Sometimes weâ€™re not even sure itâ€™ s an ability . When we see people with
outstanding inte rpersonal skills,  we donâ€™ t really think of them as gifted. W e
think of them as cool people or charming people. When we see a great
marriage relationship, we donâ€™ t say these people are brilliant relationship
makers. W e say theyâ€™re fine p eople. Or they have chemistry . Meaning
what?
Meaning that as a society , we donâ€™ t understand relationship sk ills. Y et
everything is at stake in peopleâ€™ s relationships. Maybe thatâ€™ s why Daniel
Golemanâ€™ s Emotional Intelligence  st ruck such a responsive chord . It said:
There are social-emotional skills and I can tell you what they are.
Mindsets add another dimensio n. They help us understand even more
about w hy peop le often donâ€™ t learn the skills they need or use the skills they
have. Why people throw thems elves so hopefully into new relationships,
only to undermine themselves. Why love often turns into a battlefield where
the carnage is s taggering. And, most important, they help us understand
why some people ar e  able to build lasting and satisfying relationships.
MINDSETS F ALLING IN LOVE
So f ar , h aving a  fixed mindset h as meant believing your personal traits are
fixed. But in rel ationships, two more things enter the pictureâ€”your partner
and the relation ship itself. Now you can have a fixed mindset about thr ee
things. Y ou can believe that your  qualitie s are fixed, your partner â€™ s  qualities
are fixed, and the r elationshipâ€™ s  qualities are fixedâ€”that itâ€™ s inherently goodor b ad, m eant-to-be or not meant-to-be. Now all of these things are up for
judgment.
The gro wth mindset says all of these things can be developed. Allâ€”
you, your partner , and the relationshipâ€”are capable of growth and change.
In t he fixed m indset, the ideal is instant, perfect, and p erpetual
compatibility . Like it was meant to be. Like riding of f into the sunset. Like
â€œthey lived happily ever after .â€
Many pe ople wa nt to feel their relationship is special and not just some
chance occurren ce. This seems okay . So whatâ€™ s the problem with the fixed
mindset? There are two.
1. If Y ou Have to W ork at It, It  W asnâ€™t Meant to Be
One problem is that people with  the fixed mindset expect ever ything good
to happen automatically . Itâ€™ s not that the partners will work to help each
other so lve their  problems or ga in skills. Itâ€™ s that this will magically occur
through their love, sort of the w ay it happened to Sleeping Be auty , whose
coma wa s cured  by her princeâ€™ s  kiss, or to Cinderella, whose miserable life
was suddenly transformed by her prince.
Charleneâ€™ s friends told her about Max, the new musician in town. He
had come to play cello with the symphony orchestra. The next night,
Charlene and her friends went to see the orchestraâ€™ s performance, and when
they went backstage afterward, Max took Charleneâ€™ s hand and  said, â€œNext
time, let â€™ s make it longer .â€ She w as taken with his intense, romantic air , and
he was taken with her charming  manner and exotic looks. As they went out,
the inten sity grew . They seemed to understand each other deeply . They
enjoyed the same thingsâ€”food, analyzing people, travel. They both
thought, Wher e have you been all my life?
Over tim e, though, Max became moody . Actually , thatâ€™ s how he  was. It
just didnâ€™ t show at first. When he was in a bad mood, he wanted to be left
alone. Charlene wanted to talk about what was bothering hi m, but that
irritated him. â€œJust leave me alone,â€ he would insist, more  and more
forcefully . Charlene, however , would feel shut out.
Plus, his  moods didnâ€™ t always happen at convenient times. So metimes
the couple was scheduled to go out. Sometimes they had planned a special
dinner a lone. Ei ther he didnâ€™ t want to do it, or she would endure his sullensilence t hroughout the evening. If she tried to make light conversation, he
would be disappointed in her: â€œI thought you understood me.â€
Friends, seeing how much they  cared about each other , ur ged them to
work on this problem. But they both felt, with great sorrow , that if the
relationship wer e the right one,  they wouldnâ€™ t have to work so hard. If it
were the  right relationship, they  would just be able to understand and honor
each other â€™ s needs. So they grew apart and eventually broke up.
In the growth mindset, there may still be that exciting initial
combustion, but people in this mindset donâ€™ t expect magic. They believe
that a good, lasting relationship comes from ef fort and from working
through inevitable dif ferences.
But thos e with the fixed mindset donâ€™ t buy that. Remember the fixed-
mindset idea that if you have ability , you shouldnâ€™ t have to work  hard? This
is th e same belie f applied to relationships: If youâ€™re compatible, everything
should just come naturally .
Every single relationship expert disagrees with this.
Aaron Beck, the renowned psychiatrist, says that one of the most
destructive beliefs for a relationship is â€œIf we need to work a t it, thereâ€™ s
something seriously wrong with our relationship.â€
Says John Gottman, a foremost relationship researcher: â€œEvery marriage
demands an ef fort to keep it on the right track; there is a constant tension . .
. between the f orces that hold you together and those that can tear you
apart.â€
As w ith personal achievement, t his beliefâ€”that success should not need
ef fortâ€”robs peo ple of the very thing they need to make their relationship
thrive. Itâ€™ s probably why so ma ny relationships go staleâ€”because people
believe that being in love means never having to do anything taxing.
MIND READING
Part of the low-ef fort belief is t he idea that couples should be able to read
each other â€™ s minds: W e ar e like one.  My partner sho uld know what I think,
feel, and  need and I should know what my partner thinks, feels, and needs.
But this  is impossible. Mind reading instead of communicating inevitably
backfires.Elayne Savage, noted family psychologist, describes T om and Lucy .
After three months together , T om informed Lucy that the re was an
imbalance in their relationship. Lucy , reading his mind, decided T om meant
that he was less into the relatio nship than she was. She felt discouraged.
Should she break of f the relationship before he did? However , after a
therapy session, Lucy got up the  courage to find out what he me ant. T om, it
turned out, had been using a m usical term to convey his wish to fine-tune
the relationship and move it to the next level.
I almost fell into the same trap. My husband and I had met a few
months before, and everything s eemed to be going great. Then one evening,
as we were sitting together , he said to me, â€œI need more space.â€  Everything
went bl ank. I couldnâ€™ t believe what I was hearing. W as I completely
mistaken about the relationship ? Finally , I summoned my courage. â€œWhat
do you mean?â€ I asked. He said, â€œI need you to move over so I can have
more room.â€ Iâ€™m glad I asked.
AGREEING ON EVER YTHING
Itâ€™ s s trange to be lieve in mind re ading. But it makes sense when you realize
that man y people with a fixed mindset believe that a couple  should  shar e
all of each other â€™ s views.
If you do, then you donâ€™ t need  communication; you can just assume
your partner sees things the way you do.
Raymond Knee and his colleagues had couples come in and discuss
their views of their relations hip. Those with the fixed m indset felt
threatened and hostile after talk ing about even minor discr epancies  in how
they and  their partner saw the ir relationship. Even a minor discrepancy
threatened their belief that they shared all of each other â€™ s views.
Itâ€™ s i mpossible for a couple to sh are all of each other â€™ s assumpti ons and
expectations. One may assume the wife will stop working and be supported;
the other , that sh e will be an equal breadwinner . One may assume they will
have a house in the suburbs, the  other that they will have a boh emian love
nest.
Michael and Robin had just fi nished college and were about to get
married. He was the bohemian-love-nest type. He imagined that after they
were ma rried, theyâ€™d enjoy the young, hip Greenwich V illage life together .So when he found the ideal apartment, he thought sheâ€™d be delighted. When
she saw it, she went berserk. Sheâ€™d been living in crummy little apartments
all her life, and here it was all over again. Married people were supposed to
live in nice houses with new cars parked outside. They both felt betrayed,
and it didnâ€™ t get any better from there.
Couples may erroneously believ e they agree on each personâ€™ s rights and
duties. Fill in the blank:
â€œAs a husband, I have a right to ______, and my wife has the duty to
______.â€
â€œAs a wife, I have a right to ______, and my husband has the duty to
______.â€
Few thi ngs can make partners more furious than having their rights
violated. And few things can make a partner more furious than having the
other feel entitled to something you donâ€™ t think is coming to them.
John Go ttman r eports: â€œIâ€™ve interviewed newlywed men who told me
with pride, â€˜Iâ€™m not going to w ash the dishes, no way . Thatâ€™ s a womanâ€™ s
job.â€™ T w o years later the same g uys ask me, â€˜Why donâ€™ t my wife and I have
sex anymore?â€™ â€
Now , a couple may agree on tr aditional roles. Thatâ€™ s up to th em. But
thatâ€™ s dif ferent from assuming it as an entitlement.
When Janet (a financial analyst) and Phil (a real estate agent) met, he
had just gotten a new apartme nt and was thinking heâ€™d like to have a
housewarming p arty , a dinner fo r a bunch of his friends. When Janet said,
â€œLetâ€™ s do it,â€ he was thrilled. Her emphasis was on the â€œ â€™ s,â€ the us.
Because she was the more experienced cook and party giver , however , she
did mos t of the preparation, and  she did it gladly . She was deli ghted to see
how hap py he was to be having this event. The problem start ed after the
guests arrived. Phil just went to  the party . He acted like a gue st. Like she
was supposed to continue doing all the work. She was enraged.
The mature thing to do would have been to take him aside to have a
discussion. Instead, she decided to teach him a lesson. She, too, went to the
party . Fortunate ly , entitlement and retaliation did not become a pattern in
their rela tionship. Communication did. In the future, things wer e discussed,
not assumed.
A n o-ef fort relationship is a doomed relationship, not a great
relationship. It takes work to communicate accurately and it takes work toexpose and resolve conflicting hopes and beliefs. It doesnâ€™ t mean there is no
â€œthey liv ed happ ily ever after ,â€ b ut itâ€™ s more like â€œthey worked happily ever
after .â€
2. Problems Indicate Character Flaws
The second big dif ficulty with the fixed mindset is the belief that problems
are a sign of dee p-seated flaws. But just as there are no great achievements
without setbacks, there are no great relationships without conflicts and
problems along the way .
When people with a fixed minds et talk about their conflicts, the y assign
blame. Sometimes they blame  themselves, but often they blame their
partner . And they assign blame to a trait â€”a character flaw .
But it doesnâ€™ t en d there. When people blame their partner â€™ s personality
for the problem, they feel anger and disgust toward them.
And it barrels on: Since the problem comes from fixed traits, it canâ€™ t be
solved.
So o nce people with the fixed m indset see flaws in their partne rs, they
become contemp tuous of them and dissatisfied with the whole relationship.
(People with the growth mindse t, on the other hand, can see th eir partnersâ€™
imperfections and still think they have a fine relationship.)
Sometimes people with the fixed mindset blind themselves to problems
in the partner or the relationship so they wonâ€™ t have to go that route.
Everybody thou ght Y vonne was having a flirtation. She was  getting
mysterious phon e calls. She was  often late picking up the kids. Her â€œnights
out with  the girlsâ€ doubled. He r mind was often elsewhere. Her husband,
Charlie, said she was just going through a phase. â€œAll women go through
times like this,â€ he insisted. â€œIt doesnâ€™ t mean sheâ€™ s got a guy .â€
Charlieâ€™ s best friend ur ged him to look into it. But Charlie felt that if he
confronted the realityâ€”and it was negativeâ€”his world would come
crashing down. In the fixed mindset, heâ€™d have to confront the idea that
either (1) the woman he loved was a bad person, (2) he was a  bad person
and drove her away , or (3) their relationship was bad and irreparable.
He c ouldnâ€™ t handle any of those. It didnâ€™ t occur to him that there were
problems that could be solved,  that she was sending him a m essage shedesperately wanted him to hear: Donâ€™ t ta ke me for granted. I need mor e
attention.
A growt h mindset doesnâ€™ t mean he would necessarily confront her , but
he would confront it â€”the situation. Heâ€™d think about what was wrong.
Maybe explore the issue with a counselor . Make an informed decision about
what to do next. If there wer e  problems to be solved, at least thereâ€™d be a
chance.
EACH ONE A LOSER
Penelopeâ€™ s frien ds sat at home complaining that there were no good men.
Penelope went out and found them. Each time, she would find a great guy
and fall head over heels. â€œHeâ€™ s t he one,â€ sheâ€™d tell her friends as she began
reading the bridal magazines and practically writing the announcement for
the local paper . Theyâ€™d believe her because he was always a guy with a lot
going for him.
But then something would happ en. It was over for one of them when he
got her a tacky birthday present. Another put ketchup on his food and
sometimes wore  white shoes. Another had bad electronic habits: His cell
phone etiquette was poor and h e watched too much TV . And this is only a
partial list.
Assuming traits were fixed, Penelope would decide that she couldnâ€™ t
live with  these flaws. But most of these were not deep or serio us character
problems that couldnâ€™ t be addressed with a little communication.
My husb and and I had been together almost a year and, as my birthday
approached, I sent a clear message: â€œIâ€™m not mercenary , but I like a good
present.â€ He said, â€œIsnâ€™ t it the th ought that counts?â€ I replied, â€œ Thatâ€™ s what
people say when they donâ€™ t want to put thought into it.
â€œOnce a year ,â€ I continued, â€œwe each have our day . I love you and I plan
to put time and ef fort into choosing a present for you. I would like you to do
that for me, too.â€ Heâ€™ s never let me down.
Penelope assum ed that somewhere out there was someone w ho was
already perfect. Relationship e xpert Daniel W ile says that choosing a
partner i s choosing a set of problems. There are no problem-free candidates.
The trick is to acknowledge each other â€™ s limitations, and build from there.THE FLA WS FL Y
Brenda and Jack were clients of  Daniel W ile, and he tells this tale. Brenda
came home from work and told Jack a long, detailed story with no apparent
point. Ja ck was bored to tears but tried to hide it to be pol ite. Brenda,
however , could sense his true feelings, so, hoping to be more a musing, she
launched into another endless st ory , also about a project at work. Jack was
ready to burst. They were both mentally hurling traits right and left.
According to W ile, they were both thinking: Br enda is boring, Jack is
selfish,  and our r elationship is no good.
In fact, both meant well. Brenda  was afraid to say outright that she did
some great work at the of fice that day . She didnâ€™ t want to be boastful. So
instead s he talked about the tiny details of her project. Jack did nâ€™ t want to
be impo lite, so instead of as king Brenda questions or expressing his
puzzlement, he steeled himself and waited for her story to end.
Jack just needed to say , â€œY ou kn ow , honey , when you get into so many
details, I lose y our point and get frustrated. Why donâ€™ t you tell me why
youâ€™re excited about this project? Iâ€™d really love to hear that.â€
It was a problem of communication, not a problem of personality or
character . Y et in the fixed mindset, the blame came fast and furious.
By the way , I love these stories. When I was a kid, Ladiesâ€™ Home
Journal  u sed to have a feature in each issue called â€œCan This Marriage Be
Saved?â€ Usually , the answer wa s yes. I ate up those stories, fa scinated by
all the ways a m arriage could go wrong and even more fascinated by how it
could be repaired.
The story of T ed and Karen, told by Aaron Beck, is a story of how two
people with the fixed mindset went from all good traits to all bad ones in
each other â€™ s eyes.
When T ed and Karen met, t hey were opposites attracting. Karen
radiated spontaneity and lightness. T ed, a serious guy with the weight of the
world on  his shoulders, felt that her carefree presence transformed his life.
â€œEverything she says and does is charming,â€ he ef fused. In turn, T ed
represented the rock-like â€œfather figureâ€ she had never had. He was just the
kind of stable, reliable guy who could give her a sense of security .
But a few short years later , T ed saw Karen as an irresponsible airhead.
â€œShe nev er takes anything seriously . . . I canâ€™ t depend on her .â€ And Karensaw T ed as a judgmental tyrant, dissecting her every move.
In the end, this marriage was savedâ€”only because the couple learned to
respond to each other not with angry labels, but with helpful a ctions. One
day , wh en Kare n was swamped with work, T ed came home to a messy
house. H e was angry and wante d to scold her , but, drawing on what heâ€™d
learned from Beck, he instead s aid to himself, â€œWhat is the mature thing to
do?â€ He answered his own ques tion by starting to clean things up. He was
of fering Karen support rather than judgment.
CAN THIS  MARRIAGE BE SA VED?
Aaron Beck tells couples in cou nseling never to think these fix ed-mindset
thoughts: My partner is incapable of ch ange. Nothing can impr ove our
r elationship.  These ideas, he says, are almost always wrong.
Sometimes itâ€™ s hard not to think those thoughtsâ€”as in the case of Bill
and Hillary Clinton. When he was president, Clinton lied to the nation and
to hi s wife abou t his relationship with Monica Lewinsky . Hillary defended
him: â€œMy husband may have his faults, but he has never lied to me.â€
The trut h came out, as it has a way of doing, especially when he lped by
a specia l prosecutor . Hillary , betrayed and furious, now had to decide
whether Bill was a permanently  bad and untrustworthy husband or a man
who needed a lot of help.
This is a good time to bring up an important point: The be lief that
partners have the potential for change should not be confus ed with the
belief that the partner will  change. The partner has to want to change,
commit to change, and take concrete actions toward change.
The Clin tons we nt into counseling, spending one full day a week for a
year in the proc ess. Through counseling, Bill came to understa nd how , as
the c hild of alco holic parents, he had learned to lead a dual life. On the one
hand, he â€™d learned to shoulder e xcessive responsibility at an early ageâ€”for
example, as a bo y sternly forbidding his stepfather to strike his mother . On
the othe r hand, he had anoth er part of his life where he took little
responsibility , where he made believe everything was okay no matter what
was goin g on. Thatâ€™ s how he could appear on TV and earnestly vow that he
was not involved  with Lewinsky . He was in that no-responsibility and high-
denial space.People were ur ging Hillary to for give him. One evening, Stevie W onder
called the White House to ask if  he could come over . He had written a song
for her on the power of for giveness, and he played it to her that night.
Y et Hillary could not have for given a person she saw as a liar and a
cheat. She could only for give a man she thought was earnestly struggling
with his problems and trying to grow .
THE P ARTNER AS ENEMY
W ith the  fixed mindset, one mo ment your partner is the light of your life,
the next  theyâ€™re your adversary . Why would people want to transform the
loved one into an enemy?
When y ou fail at other tasks, it â€™ s hard to keep blaming someo ne else.
But when something goes wr ong in a relationship, itâ€™ s easy to blame
someone else. In fact, in the fixed mindset you have a limited set of choices.
One is to blame  your own permanent qualities. And one is to blame your
partner â€™ s. Y ou can see how tem pting it is to foist the blame on to the other
guy .
As a legacy of my fixed mindset, I still have an irresistible ur ge to
defend myself and assign blam e when something in a relatio nship goes
wrong. â€œ Itâ€™ s not  my fault!â€ T o deal with this bad habit, my husband and I
invented a third party , an imaginary man named Maurice. Whe never I start
in on whoâ€™ s to blame, we invoke poor Maurice and pin it on him.
Remember how hard it is for people with the fixed mindset to for give?
Part of it is that they feel brand ed by a rejection or breakup. But another
part is that if they for give the partner , if they see him or her as a decent
person, then they have to shoulder more of the blame themselves: If my
partner â€™ s a good guy , then I must be a bad guy . I must be the person who
was at fault.
The same thing can happen with parents. If you have a troubled
relationship with  a parent, whose fault is it? If your parents did nâ€™ t love you
enough, were they bad parents or were you unlovable? These are the ugly
questions that haunt us within a fixed mindset. Is there a way out?
I had  thi s very dilemma. My mother didnâ€™ t love me. Most of my  life Iâ€™d
coped with this by blaming her and feeling bitter . But I was no longer
satisfied just protecting myself. I longed for a loving relationship with mymother . Y et the last thing I wanted to be was one of those kids who begged
for approval from a withhold ing parent. Then I realized so mething. I
controlled half of the relationship, my half. I could have my half of the
relationship. At least I could  be the loving daughter I wanted to be. In a
sense, it didnâ€™ t matter what she did. I would still be ahead of where I was.
How did  it turn out? I experienc ed a tremendous sense of growt h letting
go o f m y bittern ess and stepping forward to have the relationship. The rest
is n ot really rel evant since I w asnâ€™ t seeking validation, but Iâ€™ll tell you
anyway . Something unexpected happened. Three years later , my mother
said to me: â€œIf anyone had told me I didnâ€™ t love my children, I would have
been ins ulted. But now I realiz e it was true. Whether it was because my
parents d idnâ€™ t love us or becaus e I was too involved in myself o r because I
didnâ€™ t know what love was, I donâ€™ t know . But now I know what it is.â€
From that time until her death twenty-five years later , we becam e closer
and closer . As lively as each of us was, we came even more to life in each
other â€™ s presence . Once, a few  years ago, after sheâ€™d had a stroke, the
doctors warned me she couldnâ€™ t speak and might never spe ak again. I
walked into her room, she loo ked at me and said, â€œCarol, I love your
outfit.â€
What allowed me to take that first step, to choose growth and risk
rejection? In the fixed mindset,  I had needed my blame and b itterness. It
made me feel more righteous, powerful, and whole than thinking I was at
fault. Th e growt h mindset allowed me to give up the blame and move on.
The growth mindset gave me a mother .
I remember when we were kids and did something dumb, like drop our
ice-cream cone on our foot, weâ€™d turn to our friend and say , â€œLook what
you mad e me do.â€ Blame may m ake you feel less foolish, but you still have
a shoe full of ice creamâ€”and a friend whoâ€™ s on the defensive. In a
relationship, the  growth mindset lets you rise above blame, und erstand the
problem, and try to fix itâ€”together .
COMPETITION: WHOâ€™S THE GREA TEST?
In the fixed mindset, where youâ€™ve got to keep proving your competence,
itâ€™ s easy  to get into a competit ion with your partner . Whoâ€™ s the smarter ,
more talented, more likable one?Susan had a boyfriend who worried that she would be the center of
attention and he would be the tagalong. If she were someone, h e would be
no o ne. But Martin was far from no one. He was very successful, even
revered, in his fi eld. He was handsome and well liked, too. So a t first Susan
pooh-poohed the whole thing. Then they attended a conference together .
Theyâ€™d arrived separately and, in checking in, Susan had chatt ed with the
friendly hotel staf f in the lobb y . That evening when the cou ple walked
through the lobby , the whole staf f greeted her warmly . Martin grunted.
Next, they took a taxi to dinn er . T oward the end of the ride, the driver
started singing her praises: â€œY ou better hold on to her . Y es, sir , sheâ€™ s a good
one.â€ Martin winced. The whole weekend continued in this vein, and by the
time the y got home from the  conference their relationship was very
strained.
Martin wasnâ€™ t actively competitive. He didnâ€™ t try to outdo Susan, he just
lamented her seemingly greater popularity . But some partners throw their
hats right into the ring.
Cynthia, a scientist, was amazing at almost everything she didâ€”so
much so  that she left her partner s in the dust. That might have b een all right
if she didnâ€™ t always venture into their territory . She married an actor , and
then started writing plays and acting in themâ€”superbly . She said she was
just trying to s hare his life a nd his interests, but her part- time hobby
outshone his career . He felt he had to escape from the relationship to find
himself again. Next, she marrie d a musician who was a great cook, and in
no time flat she was tickling the  ivories and inventing unbelievable recipes.
Once again, the depressed husband eventually fled. Cynthia left her partners
no room  for their own identity ; she needed to equal or surpass them in
every skill they arrived with.
There are many good ways to support our partners or show interest in
their lives. This is not one of them.
DEVELOPING IN RELA TIONSHIPS
When people embark on a rela tionship, they encounter a partner who is
dif ferent from them, and they havenâ€™ t learned how to dea l with the
dif ferences. In a good relationship, people develop these skills and, as theydo, b oth partners grow and the r elationship deepens. But for this to happen,
people need to feel theyâ€™re on the same side.
Laura w as lucky . She could be self-centered and defensive. Sh e could
yell and pout. But James never took it personally and always felt that she
was there for hi m when he need ed her . So when she lashed out, he calmed
her down and made her talk things through with him. Over time, she
learned to skip the yelling and pouting.
As an atmosphe re of trust deve loped, they became vitally interested in
each other â€™ s development. James was forming a corporation, and Laura
spent hours with him discussing  his plans and some of the problems he was
encountering. Laura had always dreamed of writing childrenâ€™ s books. James
got her to spell out her ideas and write a first draft. He ur ged her to contact
someone they knew who was an illustrator . In the context of this
relationship, each partner was helping the other to do the things they wanted
to do and become the person they wanted to be.
Not long  ago, I was talking to a friend about the view some peo ple hold
of ch ildrearingâ€”that parents ma ke little dif ference. In explaining that view ,
she like ned it to a marriage rel ationship: â€œItâ€™ s like partners in a marriage.
Each comes to the relationship fully formed, and you donâ€™ t expect to
influence who the partner is.â€
â€œOh no,â€ I replied. â€œT o me the whole point of marriage is to encourage
your partner â€™ s development and have them encourage yours.â€
By t hat I didnâ€™ t mean a My Fair Lady  kind  of  thing where you attempt
an e xtreme makeover on partner s, who then feel they arenâ€™ t good enough as
they are . I mean helping partners, within the relationship, to reach their own
goals and fulfill their own potential. This is the growth mindset in action.
FRIENDSHIP
Friendships, like partnerships, are places where we have a chance to
enhance each other â€™ s developm ent, and to validate each other . Both are
important. Friends can give each other the wisdom and coura ge to make
growth-enhancing decisions, and friends can reassure each ot her of their
fine qualities. Despite the dangers of praising traits, there are times when
we need  reassur ance about ourselves: â€œT ell me Iâ€™m not a bad person forbreaking up with my boyfriend .â€ â€œT ell me Iâ€™m not stupid even though I
bombed on the exam.â€
In fa ct, these oc casions give us a chance to provide support and give a
growth message : â€œY ou gave that relationship everything you had for three
years an d he made no ef fort to i mprove things. I think youâ€™re ri ght to move
on.â€ Or â€œWhat happened on th at exam? Do you understand th e material?
Did you study enough? Do you think you need a tutor? Letâ€™ s talk about it.â€
But as in all relationships, peopleâ€™ s need to prove themselves can tilt the
balance in the wrong direction. Sheri Levy did a study that wa s not about
friendship, but makes an important and relevant point.
Levy measured adolescent boys â€™ self-esteem and then asked them how
much they believed in negative stereotypes about girls. For example, how
much di d they believe that girls  were worse in math or that gir ls were less
rational than boys? She then measured their self-esteem again.
Boys wh o believ ed in the fixed  mindset showed a boost in self-esteem
when th ey endorsed the stereotypes. Thinking that girls were dumber and
more sca tterbrained made them feel better about themselves. (Boys with the
growth mindset were less likely to agree with the stereotypes, but even
when they did, it did not give them an ego boost.)
This me ntality c an intrude on fr iendships. The low er you ar e, the better
I feel  is the idea.
One day  I was t alking to a dear , wise friend. I was puzzled about why
she put up with the behavior of s ome of her friends. Actually , I was puzzled
about why she even had these friends. One often acted irresponsibly;
another flirted shamelessly with  her husband. Her answer was that everyone
has virtues and foibles, and that, really , if you looked only for perfect
people, your social circle would be impoverished. There was, however , one
thing sh e would  not put up with: people who made her feel bad about
herself.
W e a ll k now the se people. They can be brilliant, charming, and fun, but
after being with them, you feel diminished. Y ou may ask: â€œAm I just doing
a nu mber on myself?â€ But it is often them, trying to build themselves up by
establishing their superiority an d your inferiority . It could be by actively
putting you down, or it could b e by the careless way they treat you. Either
way , you are a vehicle for (and a casualty of) confirming their worth.I was at a friendâ€™ s fiftieth-birthday party and her sister gave a speech,
supposedly in her honor . Her sister talked about my friendâ€™ s insatiable
sexual appetite and how lucky it was she found a younger man to marry
who could handle it. â€œAll in good fun,â€ she took care of my friendâ€™ s looks,
brains, and mothering skills. After this tribute, I suddenly recalled the
saying â€œW ith friends like this, you donâ€™ t need enemies.â€
Itâ€™ s dif ficult to realize when friends donâ€™ t wish you well. One night I
had the most vivid dream. Someone, someone I knew well, came into my
house and one by one took all m y prized possessions. In the dr eam I could
see what was happening, but I couldnâ€™ t see who it was. At one point, I
asked the intruder: â€œCouldnâ€™ t y ou please leave that one, it means a lot to
me.â€ Bu t the person just kept ta king everything of value. The n ext morning
I realized who it was and what it meant. For the past year a close friend had
been cal ling upon me constantly to help him with his work. I obliged. He
was und er a great deal of stress, and I was at first happy to u se whatever
skills I had for his benefit. But i t was endless, it was not reciprocal, and on
top o f that he punished me for it: â€œDonâ€™ t think you  could ever do w ork this
good. Y ou can help me polish  my work, but you could never be this
creative.â€ He needed to reduce me so he wouldnâ€™ t feel one down. My dream
told me it was time to draw the line.
Iâ€™m afra id that in the fixed mindset, I was also a culprit. I donâ€™ t think I
put people down, but when you need validation, you use people for it. One
time, wh en I was a graduate student, I was taking the train to Ne w Y ork and
sat n ext to a very nice businessman. In my opinion, we chatted back and
forth pleasantly through the hou r -and-a-half journey , but at the end he said
to m e, â€œThank you for telling me about yourself.â€ It really hit me. He was
the dream validatorâ€”handsome, intelligent, successful. And thatâ€™ s what I
had used  him for . I had shown no interest in him as a person, on ly in him as
a mi rror of my excellence. Luck ily for me, what he mirrored back was a far
more valuable lesson.
Conventional wisdom says that you know who your friends are  in your
times of  need. And of course th is view has merit. Who will stand by you
day after day wh en youâ€™re in tro uble? However , sometimes an even tougher
question is: Who can you turn to when good things happen? Wh en you find
a wonde rful par tner . When you get a great job of fer or promo tion. When
your child does well. Who would be glad to hear it?Y our failures and misfortunes donâ€™ t threaten other peopleâ€™ s self-esteem.
Ego-wise, itâ€™ s easy to be sympathetic to someone in need. Itâ€™ s your assets
and you r successes that are pr oblems for people who derive their self-
esteem from being superior .
SHYNESS
In so me ways, s hyness is the f lip side of what weâ€™ve been talking about.
W eâ€™ve been examining people who use others to buoy themsel ves up. Shy
people worry that others will b ring them down. They often w orry about
being judged or embarrassed in social situations.
Peopleâ€™ s shyness can hold them back from making friends and
developing relationships. When theyâ€™re with new people, shy people report
that they  feel anxious, their hearts race, they blush, they avoid eye contact,
and they  may try to end the int eraction as soon as possible. U nderneath it
all, s hy p eople m ay be wonderful and interesting, but they often canâ€™ t show
it with someone new . And they know it.
What can mindsets teach us about shyness? Jennifer Beer studied
hundreds of people to find o ut. She measured peopleâ€™ s mindsets, she
assessed their shyness, and then  she brought them together two at a time to
get acquainted. The whole thin g was filmed, and, later on, trained raters
watched the film and evaluated the interactions.
Beer fou nd, first , that people wi th the fixed mindset were more likely to
be s hy . This makes sense. The fixed mindset makes you conc erned about
judgment, and this can make you more self-conscious and anxious. But
there were plenty of shy people with both mindsets, and when s he looked at
them more closely , she found something even more interesting.
Shyness harmed  the social interactions of people with the fixed mindset
but d id n ot harm  the social r elat ions of people with the gr owth mindset.  The
observersâ€™ ratings showed that, although both fixed- and growth-minded
shy peop le look ed very nervous for the first five minutes of the  interaction,
after that the shy growth-minded people showed greater social skills, were
more likable, and created a mor e enjoyable interaction. In fact, they began
to look just like non-shy people.
This happened for good reasons . For one thing, the shy growth-minded
people looked on social situations as challenges. Even though they feltanxious, they actively welcomed the chance to meet someone n ew . The shy
fixed people, instead, wanted to avoid meeting someone who might be more
socially skilled than they were. They said they were more worried about
making mistakes. So the fixed- and growth-mindset people confronted the
situation with dif ferent attitudes . One embraced the challenge and the other
feared the risk.
Armed w ith thes e dif ferent attitudes, the shy growth-mindset people felt
less shy  and nervous as the inte raction wore on, but the shy fixed-mindset
people continued to be nervous and continued to do more socially awkward
things, like avoiding eye contact or trying to avoid talking.
Y ou can see how  these dif ferent patterns would af fect making friends.
The shy growth-mindset people take control of their shyness. They go out
and meet new people, and, after  their nerves settle down, their relationships
proceed normally . The shyness doesnâ€™ t tyrannize them.
But for fixed-mindset people, th e shyness takes control. It kee ps them
out of social situations with new people, and when theyâ€™re in them, they
canâ€™ t let down their guard and let go of their fears.
Scott W e tzler , a therapist and professor of psychiatry , paints a portrait of
his clien t Geor ge, a picture of the shy fixed-mindset person. Geor ge was
incredibly shy , especially with w omen. He was so eager to look cool, witty ,
and confidentâ€” and so worried that heâ€™d look overeager and ine ptâ€”that he
froze an d acted cold. When hi s attractive co-worker Jean started flirting
with him, he bec ame so flustered that he began avoiding her . Then one day
she appr oached him in a nearby cof fee shop and cutely suggeste d he ask her
to jo in h im. When he couldnâ€™ t think of a clever response to imp ress her , he
replied, â€œIt doesnâ€™ t matter to me if you sit down or not.â€
Geor ge, what  were you doing? He was trying to protect himself from
rejectionâ€”by tr ying not to seem  too interested. And he was trying to end
this awk ward situation. In a strange way , he succeeded. He certainly didnâ€™ t
seem too interested, and the interaction soon ended, as Jean got out of there
real fast . He was just like the pe ople in Jennifer Beer â€™ s study , controlled by
his fear of social judgment and prevented from making contact.
W etzler slowly helped Geor ge get over his exclusive focus on being
judged. Jean, he came to see, w as not out to judge and humiliate him, but
was tryi ng to get to know him. W ith the focus switched from b eing judged
to devel oping a relationship, Geor ge was eventually able to reciprocate.Despite his anxiety , he approached Jean, apologized for his rude behavior ,
and aske d her to lunch. She acc epted. Whatâ€™ s more, she was not nearly as
critical as he feared.
BULLIES AND VICTIMS: REVENGE REVISITED
W eâ€™re b ack to rejection, because itâ€™ s not just in love relationships that
people experience terrible rejections. It happens every day in schools.
Starting in grade school, some  kids are victimized. They ar e ridiculed,
tormented, and beaten up, not for anything theyâ€™ve done wrong. It could be
for their more timid personality , how they look, what their background is, or
how smart they are (sometimes theyâ€™re not smart enough; sometimes
theyâ€™re t oo smart). It can be a d aily occurrence that makes life a nightmare
and ushers in years of depression and rage.
T o make matters worse, schools often do nothing about it. This is
because itâ€™ s often done out of sight of teachers or because itâ€™ s done by the
schoolâ€™ s favorite students, such  as the jocks. In this case, it may be the
victims,  n ot the bullies, who are considered to be the problem kids or  the
misfits.
As a  society , w eâ€™ve paid little attention until recently . Then c ame the
school s hootings. At Columbin e, the most notorious one, both boys had
been mercilessly  bullied for years. A fellow bullying victim des cribes what
they endured in their high school.
In the hallways,  the jocks woul d push kids into lockers and call them
demeaning nam es while everyone laughed at the show . At lunch the jocks
would knock their victimsâ€™ food  trays onto the floor , trip them, or pelt them
with foo d. Whil e the victims we re eating, they would be pushed  down onto
the table from behind. Then in the locker rooms before gym class, the
bullies would beat the kids up because the teachers werenâ€™ t around.
Who Are the Bullies?
Bullying is about judging. Itâ€™ s about establishing who is mor e worthy or
important. The more powerful kids judge the less powerful kids. They judge
them to be less valuable human beings, and they rub their face s in it on a
daily basis. And itâ€™ s clear what  the bullies get out of it. Like the boys inSheri Levyâ€™ s study , they get a b oost in self-esteem. Itâ€™ s not that bullies are
low in self-estee m, but judging and demeaning others can give them a self-
esteem rush. Bullies also gain s ocial status from their actions. Others may
look up to them and judge them to be cool, powerful, or funny . Or may fear
them. Either way , theyâ€™ve upped their standing.
Thereâ€™ s a big do se of fixed-mindset thinking in the bullies: Som e people
are superior and some are inferior . And the bullies are the j udges. Eric
Harris, one of the Columbine shooters, was their perfect tar get. He had a
chest deformity , he was short, he was a computer geek, and he was an
outsider , not from Colorado. They judged him mercilessly .
V ictims and Revenge
The fixed mindset may also play a role in how the victim reacts to bullying.
When people feel deeply judged  by a rejection, their impulse is to feel bad
about themselves and to lash out in bitterness. They have been cruelly
reduced and they wish to redu ce in return. In our studies, we have seen
perfectly normal peopleâ€”children and adultsâ€”respond to rejection with
violent fantasies of revenge.
Highly educated , well-functioning adults, after telling us about a serious
rejection or betrayal, say and m ean â€œI wanted him deadâ€ or â€œI could easily
have strangled her .â€
When we hear about acts of school violence, we usually think itâ€™ s only
bad kids from bad homes who could ever take matters into their  own hands.
But itâ€™ s startling how quickly average, everyday kids with a fixed mindset
think about violent revenge.
W e g ave eighth-grade students i n one of our favorite schools a scenario
about bullying to read. W e asked them to imagine it was happening to them.
It is  a new school year and th ings seem to be going pretty well.
Suddenly some popular kids start teasing you and calling you
names. At first you brush it of fâ€”these things happen. But it
continues. Every day they follow you, they taunt you, they make fun
of what youâ€™re wearing, they make fun of what you look like, they
tell you youâ€™re a loserâ€”in front of everybody . Every day .W e then  asked them to write about what they would think and w hat they
would do or want to do.
First, the students with the f ixed mindset took the incident more
personally . They  said, â€œI would think I was a nobody and that nobody likes
me.â€ Or â€œI would think I was stupid and weird and a misfit.â€
Then the y wanted violent revenge, saying that theyâ€™d explode with rage
at them,  punch their faces in, o r run them over . They str ongly  agreed with
the statement: â€œMy number one goal would be to get revenge.â€
They had been judged and they wanted to judge back. Thatâ€™ s what Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold, the C olumbine shooters, did. They judged back.
For a few long, terrible hours, they decided who would live and who would
die.
In our study , the students with the growth mindset were not as prone to
see the bullying as a reflection of who they were. Instead, they saw it as a
psychological problem of the bullies, a way for the bullies to gain status or
char ge t heir self -esteem: â€œIâ€™d think that the reason he is bothering me is
probably that he has problems at home or at school with his grades.â€ Or
â€œThey need to get a lifeâ€”not just feel good if they make me feel bad.â€
Their plan was often designed to educate the bullies: â€œI would really
actually talk to them. I would a sk them questions (why are they saying all
of these things a nd why are they  doing all of this to me).â€ Or â€œConfront the
person a nd discu ss the issue; I would feel like trying to help them see they
are not funny .â€
The students with the growth mindset also strongly agreed that: â€œI
would w ant to for give them eventuallyâ€ and â€œMy number one goal would
be to help them become better people.â€
Whether theyâ€™d  succeed in personally reforming or educating
determined bullies is doubtful. However , these are certainly more
constructive first steps than running them over .
Brooks Brown, a classmate of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, was
bullied f rom third grade on. He  suf fered tremendously , yet he didnâ€™ t look
for revenge. He rejected the fix ed mindset and the right of people to judge
others, as in â€œI am a football player , and therefore Iâ€™m better than you.â€ Or
â€œI am a basketball player . . . pathetic geeks like you are not on my level.â€
More than that, he actively embraced a growth mindset. In his own
words, â€œPeople do have the pot ential to change.â€ Even maybe Eric Harris,the m ore depressed, hostile lead er of the shootings. Brown had  had a very
serious r un-in w ith Eric Harris s everal years before, but in their  senior year
of h igh school, Brown of fered a truce. â€œI told him that I had ch anged a lot
since that year . . . and that I hoped he felt the same way about himself.â€
Brooks went on to say that if he found that Eric hadnâ€™ t change d, he could
always pull back. â€œHowever , if he had grown up, then why not give him the
chance to prove it.â€
Brooks hasnâ€™ t given up. He still wants to change people. He w ants to
wake up the world to the problem of bullying, and he wants to reach victims
and turn them of f their violent fantasies. So heâ€™ s worked for the filmmaker
Michael Moore on Bowling for Columbine  and heâ€™ s set up an innovative
website where bullied kids can c ommunicate with each other and learn that
the answer isnâ€™ t to kill. â€œItâ€™ s to use your mind and make things better .â€
Brooks, like me, does not see the shooters as people who are a world
apart fro m ever yone else. His f riend Dylan Klebold, he says, was once a
regular kid from a fine home with loving, involved parents.  In fact, he
warns, â€œW e can just sit back and call the shooters â€˜sick monsters,
completely dif ferent from us.â€™ . . . Or we can accept that there are more
Erics an d Dylan s out there, who  are slowly being driven . . . down the same
path.â€
Even if a victim doesnâ€™ t have a  fixed mindset to begin with, prolonged
bullying can instill it. Especially if others stand by and do nothing, or even
join in. V ictims say that when theyâ€™re taunted and demeaned and no one
comes t o their defense, they start to believe they deserve it. T hey start to
judge themselves and to think that they ar e  inferior .
Bullies judge. V ictims take it in . Sometimes it remains inside and can
lead to depression and suicide. Sometimes it explodes into violence.
What Can Be Done?
Individual child ren canâ€™ t usually stop the bullies, especially when the
bullies attract a group of suppo rters. But the school canâ€”by changing the
school mindset.
School cultures often promote,  or at least accept, the fixed m indset.
They accept that some kids feel superior to others and feel entitled to pickon th em. They also consider som e kids to be misfits whom they can do little
to help.
But som e schools have created a dramatic reduction in bullying by
fighting the atmosphere of judgment and creating one of collaboration and
self-improvement. Stan Davis, a therapist, school counselor , and consultant,
has developed an anti-bullying program that works. Building on the work of
Dan Olweus, a r esearcher in Norway , Davisâ€™ s program helps bullies change,
supports victims, and empowers bystanders to come to a victimâ€™ s aid.
W ithin a  few years, physical bullying in his school was down 93 percent
and teasing was down 53 percent.
Darla, a third gr ader , was overweight, awkward, and a â€œcrybaby .â€ She
was such a prim e tar get that ha lf of the class bullied her , hitting her and
calling her names on a daily basisâ€”and winning one another â€™ s a pproval for
it. Several years later , because of Davisâ€™ s program, the bullying had
stopped. Darla had learned bett er social skills and even had friends. Then
Darla w ent to middle school and , after a year , came back to repo rt what had
happened. Her classmates from  elementary school had seen her through.
Theyâ€™d helped her make friends and protected her from her new peers when
they wanted to harass her .
Davis also gets the bullies changing. In fact, some of the k ids who
rushed to Darlaâ€™ s support in middle school were the same ones who had
bullied her earlier . What Davis does is this. First, while enforcing consistent
discipline, he doesnâ€™ t judge the bully as a person. No criticism i s directed at
traits. Instead, he makes them feel liked and welcome at school every day .
Then he praises every step in th e right direction. But again, he does not
praise the person; he praises their ef fort. â€œI notice that you have been
staying out of fi ghts. That tells me you are working on getting along with
people.â€ Y ou can see that Davis is leading students directly to the growth
mindset. He is h elping them see their actions as part of an ef fort  to improve.
Even if the change was not intentional on the part of the bullie s, they may
now try to make it so.
Stan Davis has incorporated our work on praise, criticism, and mindsets
into his program, and it has worked. This is a letter I got from him.
Dear Dr . Dweck:Y our research has radically changed the way I work with
students. I am already seeing positive results from my own dif ferent
use of language to give feedback to young people. Next year our
whole school is embarking on an initiative to build student
motivation based on [growth] feedback.
Y ours,
Stan Davis
Haim G inott, the  renowned child psychologist, also shows how teachers
can point bullies away from judgment and toward improvement and
compassion. He re is a letter from a teacher to an eight-year -old bully in her
class. Notice that she doesnâ€™ t imply heâ€™ s a bad person, and she shows
respect b y referring to his leadership, by using big words, and b y asking for
his advice.
Dear Jay ,
Andyâ€™ s mother has told me that her son has been made very
unhappy this year . Name-calling and ostracism have left him sad
and lonely . I feel concerned about the situation. Y our experience as a
leader in your class makes you a likely person for me to turn to for
advice. I value your ability to sympathize with those who suf fer .
Please write me your suggestions about how we can help Andy .
Sincerely ,
Y our teacher .
In a New Y ork T imes  article on bullying, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold
are r eferred to a s â€œtwo misfit t eenagers.â€ Itâ€™ s true. They didnâ€™ t fit in. But
you neve r hear the bullies referred to as misfits. Because they w erenâ€™ t. They
fit right in. In fact, they defined and ruled the school culture.
The not ion that  some people a re entitled to brutalize others is not a
healthy o ne. Stan Davis points o ut that as a society , we rejected the idea that
people were entitled to brutaliz e blacks and harass women. Why do we
accept the idea that people are entitled to brutalize our children?â– 
â– 
â– 
â– By doing so, we also insult the bullies. W e tell them we don â€™ t think
theyâ€™re capable of more, and we miss the chance to help th em become
more.
Grow Y our Mindset
After a rejection, do you feel ju dged, bitter , and vengeful? Or do
you feel hurt, b ut hopeful of for giving, learning, and moving o n?
Think of  the worst rejection you ever had. Get in touch with all the
feelings, and see if you can view it from a growth mindset. What
did y ou learn fro m it? Did it teach you something about what y ou
want an d donâ€™ t want in your lif e? Did it teach you some positive
things th at were useful in later relationships? Can you for give t hat
person and wish them well? Can you let go of the bitterness?
Picture your ideal love relationship. Does it involve perfect
compatibilityâ€”no disagreement s, no compromises, no hard wo rk?
Please think again. In every re lationship, issues arise. T ry to see
them from a growth mindset: Problems can be a vehicle for
developing grea ter understandin g and intimacy . Allow your partner
to air his or her dif ferences, listen carefully , and discuss them in a
patient and caring manner . Y ou may be surprised at the closeness
this creates.
Are you  a blamer like me? Itâ€™ s  not good for a relationship to pin
everything on your partner . Cre ate your own Maurice and blame
him instead. Better yet, work tow ard curing yourself of the need  to
blame. Move beyond thinking about fault and blame all the time.
Think of me trying to do that too.
Are you shy? Then you really need the growth mindset. Even if it
doesnâ€™ t cure your shyness, it w ill help keep it from messing up
your soc ial inte ractions. Next time youâ€™re venturing into a soc ial
situation, think about these thing s: how social skills are things you
can imp rove and how social interactions are for learning a nd
enjoyment, not judgment. Keep practicing this.Chapter 7
P ARENTS, TEACHERS, AND COACHES: WHERE DO MINDSETS
COME FROM?
N o parent thinks, â€œI wonder what I can do today to undermine my
children, subve rt their ef fort, turn them of f learning, and limit their
achievement.â€ O f course not. They think, â€œI would do any thing, give
anything, to make my children successful.â€ Y et many of the things they do
boomerang. Th eir helpful judgments, their lessons, their motivating
techniques often send the wrong message.
In fact, every word and action can send a message. It tells childrenâ€”or
students, or athletesâ€”how to t hink about themselves. It can be a fixed-
mindset message that says: Y ou have permanent traits and Iâ€™m judging
them.  Or  it can be a growth-mindset message that says: Y ou ar e a
developing person and I am committed to your development.
Itâ€™ s remarkable how sensitive children are to these messages, and how
concerned they are about them.  Haim Ginott, the child-rearing sage of the
1950s th rough â€™7 0s, tells this story . Bruce, age five, went with his mother to
his new kinder g arten. When they arrived, Bruce looked up at the paintings
on the wall and said, â€œWho made those ugly pictures?â€ His mother rushed
to correct him: â€œ Itâ€™ s not nice to call pictures ugly when they ar e so pretty .â€
But his teacher knew exactly wh at he meant. â€œIn here,â€ she said, â€œyou donâ€™ t
have to paint pr etty pictures. Y ou can paint mean pictures if you feel like
it.â€ Bruce gave her a big smile.  She had  answer ed his real ques tion: What
happens to a boy who doesnâ€™ t paint well?
Next, Bruce spotted a broken fire engine. He picked it up and asked in a
self-righteous tone, â€œWho broke  this fire engine?â€ Again his mother rushed
in: â€œWh at dif fer ence does it make to you who broke it? Y ou donâ€™ t knowanyone here.â€ But the teacher u nderstood. â€œT oys are for playing,â€ she told
him. â€œSometime s they get broken. It happens.â€ Again, his q uestion was
answered: What happens to boys who break toys?
Bruce waved to his mother and went of f to start his first day of
kinder garten. This was not a place where he would be judged and labeled.
Y ou know , we n ever outgrow our sensitivity to these messages. Several
years ag o, my husband and I sp ent two weeks in Provence, in the south of
France. Everyon e was wonderful to usâ€”very kind and very ge nerous. But
on the last day , we drove to Italy for lunch. When we got there and found a
little family restaurant, tears s tarted streaming down my face. I felt so
nurtured. I said to David, â€œY ou know , in France, when theyâ€™re nice to you,
you feel like youâ€™ve passed a test. But in Italy , there is no test.â€
Parents and teachers who send fixed-mindset messages are like France,
and parents and teachers who send growth-mindset messages are like Italy .
Letâ€™ s sta rt with the messages p arents send to their childrenâ€”but, you
know , th ey are also messages that teachers can send to their students or
coaches can send to their athletes.
P ARENTS (AND TEACHERS): MESSAGES ABOUT SUCCESS AND
F AILURE
Messages About Success
Listen for the messages in the following examples:
â€œY ou learned that so quickly! Y ouâ€™re so smart!â€
â€œLook at that drawing. Martha, is he the next Picasso or what?â€
â€œY ouâ€™re so brilliant, you got an A without even studying!â€
If y ouâ€™re like most parents, y ou hear these as supportive, esteem-
boosting messages. But listen more closely . See if you can hear another
message. Itâ€™ s the one that children hear:
If I donâ€™ t learn something quickly , Iâ€™m not smart.
I shouldnâ€™ t try drawing anything har d or theyâ€™ll see Iâ€™m no Picasso.
Iâ€™d better quit studying or they wonâ€™ t think Iâ€™m brilliant.
How do  I know this? Remember chapter 3 , how I was thin king about all
the praise parents were lavishing on their kids in the hope of encouraging
confidence and achievement? Y ouâ€™re so smart. Y ouâ€™re so talen ted. Y ouâ€™re
such a natural athlete. And I thought, wait a minute. Isnâ€™ t it the kids with thefixed mindsetâ€”the vulnerable kidsâ€”who are obsessed with this? W ouldnâ€™ t
harping on intelligence or talent make kidsâ€”all kidsâ€”even more obsessed
with it?
Thatâ€™ s w hy we set out to study this. After seven experiments with
hundreds of children, we had some of the clearest findings Iâ€™ve ever seen:
Praising childre nâ€™ s intelligence harms their motivation and it harms their
performance.
How can that be? Donâ€™ t children love to be praised?
Y es, chi ldren love praise. And they especially love to be praised for
their intelligence  and talent. It really does give them a boost, a special glow
â€”but on ly for the moment. The minute they hit a snag, their  confidence
goes out the w indow and their motivation hits rock bottom . If success
means t heyâ€™re smart, then failure means theyâ€™re dumb. Thatâ€™ s the fixed
mindset.
Here is the voice of a mother w ho saw the ef fects of well-meant praise
for intelligence:
I wa nt to share my real-life experience with you. I am the mother of
a ve ry intelligent fifth grader .  He consistently scores in the  99
percentile on standardized school tests in math, language and
science, but he has had some v ery real â€œself-worthâ€ problems.  My
husband, who is also an intelli gent person, felt his parents never
valued intellect and he has o vercompensated with our son in
attempting to praise him for â€œbeing smart.â€ Over the past years, I
have sus pected this was causing a problem, because my son, while
he e asily excels in school, is relu ctant to take on more dif ficult work
or projects (just as your studies show) because then he would t hink
heâ€™ s not smart. H e projects an over -inflated view of his abilities  and
claims h e can perform better th an others (both intellectually and in
physical activities), but will not attempt such activities, because of
course, in his failure he would be shattered.
And here is the voice of one of my Columbia students reflecting on his
history:I remember often being praised for my intelligence rather than my
ef forts, and slowly but surely I  developed an aversion to dif ficult
challenges. Most surprisingly , this extended beyond academic and
even athletic challenges to emotional challenges. This was my
greatest learning disabilityâ€”this tendency to see performance as a
reflection of character and, if I could not accomplish somet hing
right away , to avoid that task or treat it with contempt.
I know , it feels almost impossible to resist this kind of praise. W e want
our love d ones to know that we  prize them and appreciate thei r successes.
Even I have fallen into the trap.
One day I cam e home and m y husband, David, had solved a very
dif ficult problem we had been puzzling over for a while. Before I could stop
myself, I blurted out: â€œY ouâ€™re brilliant!â€ Needless to say , I was appalled at
what I had done, and as the look of horror spread over my face, he rushed to
reassure me. â€œI know you meant  it in the most â€˜growth-mindedâ€™ way . That I
searched for strategies, kept at it, tried all kinds of solutions, and finally
mastered it.â€
â€œY es,â€ I said, smiling sweetly , â€œthatâ€™ s exactly  what I meant.â€
Parents think they can hand children permanent confidenceâ€”li ke a gift
â€”by praising their brains and talent. It doesnâ€™ t work, and in fact has the
opposite ef fect. It makes childre n doubt themselves as soon as anything is
hard or anything goes wrong. If parents want to give their children a gift,
the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be
intrigued by mistakes, enjoy ef fort, seek new strategies, an d keep on
learning. That way , their children donâ€™ t have to be slaves of praise. They
will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.
SENDING MESSAGES ABOUT PROCESS AND GROWTH
So wha tâ€™ s the alternative to praising talent or intelligence? Davidâ€™ s
reassurance gives us a hint. One of my students tells us more:
I w ent home th is weekend to find my 12-year -old sister ecs tatic
about school. I a sked what she w as so excited about and she said, â€œI
got 102 on my social studies t est!â€ I heard her repeat this phraseabout fiv e more times that weekend. At that point I decided to apply
what we learned in class to this real-life situation. Rather than
praising her intelligence or her grade, I asked questions that m ade
her refle ct on the ef fort she put into studying and on how she has
improved from the year before. Last year , her grades dropped lower
and low er as the year progressed so I thought it was importan t for
me t o in tervene and steer her in  the right direction at the beginning
of this year .
Does thi s mean we canâ€™ t praise our children enthusiastically wh en they
do something great? Should we try to restrain our admiration for their
successes? Not at all. It just mea ns that we should keep away from a certain
kind  o f praiseâ€”prais e that judges their intelligence or talent. Or praise that
implies that weâ€™re proud of them for their intelligence or talent rather than
for the work they put in.
W e can appreciate them as much as we want for the growth-oriented
processâ€”what t hey accomplish ed through practice, study , persistence, and
good strategies.  And we can ask them about their work in a way that
recognizes and shows interest in their ef forts and choices.
â€œY ou really studied for your test and your improvement shows it. Y ou
read the material over several times, you outlined it, and you tested yourself
on it. It really worked!â€
â€œI li ke the way you tried all ki nds of strategies on that math problem
until you finally got it. Y ou thought of a lot of dif ferent ways to do it and
found the one that worked!â€
â€œI like that you took on that challenging project for your science class. It
will take a lot of workâ€”doing the research, designing the appar atus, buying
the parts, and building it. Boy , youâ€™re going to learn a lot of great things.â€
â€œI know school used to be easy  for you and you used to feel like the
smart ki d all the time. But the t ruth is that you werenâ€™ t using your brain to
the f ullest. Iâ€™m really excited ab out how youâ€™re stretching yourself now and
working to learn hard things.â€
â€œThat ho mework was so long an d involved. I really admire the way you
concentrated and finished it.â€
â€œThat picture has so many beautiful colors. T ell me about them.â€â€œY ou pu t so much thought into t his essay . It really makes me understand
Shakespeare in a new way .â€
â€œThe passion you put into that piano piece gives me a real feeling of joy .
How do you feel when you play it?â€
What about a student who worked hard and didnâ€™ t  do well?
â€œI liked the ef fo rt you put in, but letâ€™ s work together some m ore and
figure out what it is you donâ€™ t understand.â€
â€œW e all have dif ferent learning curves. It may take more time for you to
catch on  to this and be comfortable with this material, but if yo u keep at it
like this you will.â€
â€œEveryone learn s in a dif ferent way . Letâ€™ s keep trying to find the way
that works for you.â€
(This may be especially important for children with learning disabilities.
Often for them it is not sheer ef fort that works but finding the right
strategy .)
I wa s excited to  learn recently that Haim Ginott, through his lifelong
work wi th child ren, came to the  same conclusion. â€œPraise should deal, not
with th e childâ€™ s personality attributes, but with his ef forts and
achievements.â€
Sometimes people are careful to use growth-oriented praise with their
children but then ruin it by the way they talk about others. I have heard
parents say in f ront of their children, â€œHeâ€™ s just a born loser ,â€ â€œSheâ€™ s a
natural genius,â€  or â€œSheâ€™ s a pea-brain.â€ When children hear t heir parents
level fix ed judgments at others, it communicates a fixed mindse t. And they
have to wonder , Am I next?
This caveat applies to teachers, too! In one study , we taught students a
math les son spic ed up with som e math history , namely , stories about great
mathematicians. For half of  the students, we talked about the
mathematicians as geniuses who easily came up with their math
discoveries. This alone propelled students into a fixed mindset. It sent the
message: Ther e ar e some people who ar e born smart in math and
everything is easy for them. Then ther e ar e the r est of you.  For the other half
of the students, we talked about  the mathematicians as people w ho became
passionate about math and ended up making great discoveries. This brought
students into a growth mindset. The message was: Skills and achievementcome thr ough commitment and effort.  Itâ€™ s amazing how kids snif f out these
messages from our innocent remarks.
One mo re thing about praise. When we say to children, â€œW ow , you did
that so quickly!â€ or â€œLook, you  didnâ€™ t make any mistakes!â€ wh at message
are we sending? W e are telling them that what we prize are speed and
perfection. Spee d and perfection are the enemy of dif ficult learn ing: â€œIf you
think Iâ€™m  smart when Iâ€™m fast and perfect, Iâ€™d better not take on anything
challenging.â€ So  what should  w e say when children complet e a taskâ€”say ,
math problemsâ€”quickly and p erfectly? Should we deny them the praise
they have earned? Y es. When this happens, I say , â€œWhoops. I guess that was
too easy . I apologize for wasting your time. Letâ€™ s do something you can
really learn from!â€
REASSURING CHILDREN
How do  you make a child feel secure before a test or perform ance? The
same principle applies. Reassuri ng children about their intelligence or talent
backfires. Theyâ€™ll only be more afraid to show a deficiency .
Kristina was a really bright h igh school student who, much to her
shame, did terribly on tests. She always studied, she alway s knew the
material, but every time it cam e to the test, she got so wound up that her
mind went blank. Her grades suf fered. She disappointed her teachers. She
let her parents down. And it wa s only going to get worse as she faced the
College Board tests that the schools she longed to attend prized so highly .
The night before each test, her parents, seeing how distraught s he was,
tried to build her confidence. â€œLook, you  kno w how smart you are and we
know how smart you are. Y ouâ€™ve got this nailed. Now , stop worrying.â€
They were as supportive as they knew how to be, but they were raising
the stakes even higher . What could they have said instead?
â€œIt must be a terrible thing to feel that everyone is evaluating you and
you canâ€™ t show what you know . W e want you to know that we are not
evaluating you. W e care about your learning, and we know that youâ€™ve
learned your stuf f. W eâ€™re proud that youâ€™ve stuck to it and kept learning.â€
Messages About Failure1.

3.

5.Praising success should be the least of our problems, right? Failure seems
like a much mo re delicate matter . Children may already feel discouraged
and vuln erable. Letâ€™ s tune in ag ain, this time to the messages parents can
send in times of failure.
Nine-year -old E lizabeth was on her way to her first gymnasti cs meet.
Lanky , f lexible, and ener getic, she was just right for gymnastics, and she
loved it.  Of course, she was a l ittle nervous about competing, but she was
good at gymnastics and felt confident of doing well. She had even thought
about the perfect place in her room to hang the ribbon she would win.
In the first even t, the floor exerc ises, Elizabeth went first. Although she
did a nice job, the scoring cha nged after the first few girls and she lost.
Elizabeth also did well in the ot her events, but not well enough to win. By
the end of the evening, she had received no ribbons and was devastated.
What would you do if you were Elizabethâ€™ s parents?
T ell Elizabeth you  thought she was the best.
T ell her she was robbed of a ribbon that was rightfully hers.
Reassure her that gymnastics is not that important.
T ell her she has the ability and will surely win next time.
T ell her she didnâ€™ t deserve to win.
There is a strong message in our society about how to boost childrenâ€™ s
self-esteem, and a main part of that message is: Pr otect them fr om failur e!
While this may help with the immediate problem of  a childâ€™ s
disappointment, it can be harmful in the long run. Why?
Letâ€™ s look at the five possible reactions from a mindset point of viewâ€”
and listen to the messages:
The first ( you  t hou ght she wa s the best) is basically insincere. She was
not t he bestâ€”you know it, and she does, too. This of fers her n o recipe for
how to recover or how to improve.
The second (she was robbed) places blame on others, when in fact the
problem was mostly with her performance, not the judges. Do you want her
to grow up blaming others for her deficiencies?
The thir d (reassure her that gymnastics doesnâ€™ t really matter) teaches
her to devalue something if sh e doesnâ€™ t do well in it right a way . Is this
really the message you want to send?The fourth (she has the ability) may be the most dangerous message of
all. D oes ability automatically ta ke you where you want to go? If Elizabeth
didnâ€™ t win this meet, why should she win the next one?
The last option (tell her she didnâ€™ t deserve to win) seems hard hearted
under the circumstances. And of course you wouldnâ€™ t say it quite that way .
But thatâ€™ s pretty much what her growth-minded father told her .
Hereâ€™ s w hat he actually said: â€œElizabeth, I know how you feel. Itâ€™ s so
disappointing to have your hopes up and to perform your best but not to
win. But you know , you havenâ€™ t  really earned it yet. There were many girls
there wh oâ€™ve be en in gymnastics longer than you and whoâ€™ve worked a lot
harder t han you . If this is something you really want, then itâ€™ s something
youâ€™ll really have to work for .â€
He also let Elizabeth know that if she wanted to do gymnastics purely
for fun, that was just fine. But if she wanted to excel in the competitions,
more was required.
Elizabeth took this to heart, sp ending much more time repeating and
perfecting her routines, especially the ones she was weakest in. At the next
meet, th ere wer e eighty girls fr om all over the region. Elizabe th won five
ribbons for the individual events and was the overall champion of the
competition, hau ling home a gia nt trophy . By now , her room is so covered
with awards, you can hardly see the walls.
In essence, her f ather not only to ld her the truth, but also taught her how
to le arn from he r failures and d o what it takes to succeed in th e future. He
sympathized de eply with her disappointment, but he did not give her a
phony boost that would only lead to further disappointment.
Iâ€™ve met  with many coaches and they ask me: â€œWhat happened to the
coachable athlet es? Where did t hey go?â€ Many of the coaches  lament that
when they give their athletes co rrective feedback, the athletes grumble that
their con fidence is being undermined. Sometimes the athletes phone home
and complain to their parents. They seem to want coaches who will simply
tell them how talented they are and leave it at that.
The coa ches say that in the old days after a little league game or a
kiddie s occer ga me, parents used to review and analyze the game on the
way hom e and give helpful (pro cess) tips. Now on the ride home, they say ,
parents heap blame on the co aches and referees for the childâ€™ s poorperformance or  the teamâ€™ s loss. They donâ€™ t want to harm the childâ€™ s
confidence by putting the blame on the child.
But as in the e xample of Elizabeth above, children need honest and
constructive fee dback. If children are â€œprotectedâ€ from it, they wonâ€™ t learn
well. Th ey will experience advice, coaching, and feedback as negative and
undermining. W ithholding constructive criticism does not hel p childrenâ€™ s
confidence; it harms their future.
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM: MORE ABOUT F AILURE MESSAGES
W e alwa ys hear the term constructive criticism.  But doesnâ€™ t everyone think
the critic ism they give their children is constructive? Why wou ld they give
it if they didnâ€™ t think it was hel pful? Y et a lot if it is not helpful at all. Itâ€™ s
full of judgment about the child. Constructive  mea ns h elping t he child to fix
something, build a better product, or do a better job.
Billy rushed through his homework, skipping several questions and
answering the others in a short, sloppy way . His father hit the ro of. â€œ This  is
your homework ? Canâ€™ t you ev er get it right? Y ou are either dense or
irresponsible. Which is it?â€ The feedback managed to question his sonâ€™ s
intelligence and  character at th e same time and to imply that the defects
were permanent.
How could the dad have expre ssed his frustration and disappointment
without assassinating his sonâ€™ s attributes? Here are some ways.
â€œSon, it really makes me upset when you donâ€™ t do a full job. When do
you think you can complete this?â€
â€œSon, is there something you didnâ€™ t understand in the assignment?
W ould you like me to go over it with you?â€
â€œSon, I feel sad when I see you missing a chance to learn. Can you think
of a way to do this that would help you learn more?â€
â€œSon, this looks like a reall y boring assignment. Y ou have my
sympathy . Can you think of a w ay to make it more interesting?â€ or â€œLetâ€™ s
try to think of a way to lessen the pain and still do a good job. Do you have
any ideas?â€
â€œSon, remember I told you how tedious things help us learn to
concentrate? Th is one is a real challenge. This will really take all yourconcentration sk ills. Letâ€™ s see if you can concentrate through this whole
assignment!â€
Sometimes chil dren will judge and label themselves. Ginott tells of
Philip, a ge four teen, who was working on a project with his father and
accidentally spilled nails all over the floor . He guiltily looked at his dad and
said:
P HILIP:    Gee, Iâ€™m so clumsy .
F A THER:   Thatâ€™ s not what we say when nails spill.
P HILIP:    What do you say?
F A THER:   Y ou say , the nails spilledâ€”Iâ€™ll pick them up!
P HILIP:     Just like that?
F A THER:   Just like that.
P HILIP:    Thanks, Dad.
Children Learn the Messages
Kids wit h the fixed mindset tell us they get constant messages o f judgment
from their parents. They say they feel as though their traits are being
measured all the time.
W e asked them: â€œSuppose you r parents of fer to help you with your
schoolwork. Why would they do this?â€
They sai d: â€œThe  real reason is that they wanted to see how smart I was
at the schoolwork I was working on.â€
W e asked: â€œSuppose your parents are happy that you got a good grade.
Why would that be?â€
They said: â€œThey were happy to see I was a smart kid.â€
W e asked: â€œSuppose your paren ts discussed your performance with you
when you did poorly on something in school. Why would they do this?â€
They said: â€œThey might have been worried I wasnâ€™ t one of the bright
kids,â€ and â€œThey think bad grades might mean Iâ€™m not smart.â€
So e very time something happ ens, these children hear a mes sage of
judgment.
Maybe all kids think their parents are judging them. Isnâ€™ t that what
parents doâ€”nag and judge? Thatâ€™ s not what students with the growthmindset think. They think their p arents are just trying to encoura ge learning
and good study habits. Hereâ€™ s what they say about their parentsâ€™ motives:
Q:    Suppose your  parents of fer to  help you with your schoolwor k.
Why would they do this?
A:    They wanted to make sure I learned as much as I could from my
schoolwork.
Q:    Suppose your parents are happy that you got a good grade.
A:    Theyâ€™re happy because a good grade means that I really stuck to
my work.
Q:    S uppose you r parents discussed your performance with yo u
when you did poorly on something in school.
A:    They wanted to teach me ways to study better in the future.
Even when it w as about their conduct or their relationships, the kids
with the  fixed mindset felt judged, but the kids with the growth mindset felt
helped.
Q:    Imagine that your parents be came upset when you didnâ€™ t d o
what they asked you to do. Why would they be this way?
FIXED-MINDSET CHILD:  They were worried I might be a bad kid.
GROWTH-MINDSET CHILD:  They wanted to help me learn ways of
doing it better next time.
All kids misbehave. Research shows that normal young children
misbehave every three minutes. Does it become an occasion for judgment
of their character or an occasion for teaching?
Q:    Imagine that your parents wer e unhappy when you didnâ€™ t sha re
with other kids. Why would they be this way?
FIXED-MINDSET CHILD:  They thought it showed them what kind of
person I was.
GROWTH-MINDSET CHILD:  They wanted to help me learn better skills
for getting along with other kids.
Children learn these lessons early . Children as young as toddlers  pick up
these messages from their parents, learning that their mistakes are worthy ofjudgment and punishment. Or l earning that their mistakes are an occasion
for suggestions and teaching.
Hereâ€™ s a  kinder g arten boy we w ill never for get. Y ou will hear him role-
playing dif feren t messages from his two parents. This is the s ituation: He
wrote so me numbers in school, they contained an error , and now he tells us
how his parents would react.
M OTHER:  Hello. What are you sad about?
B OY :  I  gave my teacher some numbers and I skipped the number 8 and
now Iâ€™m feeling sad.
M OTHER:  W ell, thereâ€™ s one thing that can cheer you up.
B OY :  What?
M OTHER:  If you really tell your teacher that you tried your best, she
wouldnâ€™ t be mad at you. [T urning to father] W eâ€™re not mad, are we?
F A THER:  Oh, yes we are! Son, you better go right to your room.
I wish I could tell you he listened to his mother â€™ s growth-oriented
message. But in our study , he seemed to heed the judgmental message of his
dad, downgrading himself for his errors and having no good plan for fixing
them. Y et at least he had his mother â€™ s ef fort message that he could,
hopefully , put to use in the future.
Parents start interpreting and reacting to their childâ€™ s behavior at minute
one. A new mother tries to nurs e her baby . The baby cries and w onâ€™ t nurse.
Or takes a few sucks, gives up, and starts screaming. Is the baby stubborn?
Is th e ba by defic ient? After all, i snâ€™ t nursing an inborn reflex? A renâ€™ t babies
supposed to be â€œnaturalsâ€ at nursing? Whatâ€™ s wrong with my baby?
A new mother in this situation t old me: â€œAt first I got really frustrated.
Then I kept your work in min d. I kept saying to my baby , â€˜ W eâ€™re both
learning how to do this. I know  youâ€™re hungry . I know itâ€™ s frustrating, but
weâ€™re le arning.â€™ This way of th inking helped me stay cool an d guide her
through till it worked. It also helped me understand my baby  better so I
knew how to teach her other things, too.â€
Donâ€™ t judge. T each. Itâ€™ s a learning process.
CHILDREN P ASS ON THE MESSAGESAnother way we know that children learn these messages is that we can see
how they pass them on. Even young children are ready to pass on the
wisdom theyâ€™ve learned. W e asked second-grade children: â€œWhat advice
would you give to a child in yo ur class who was having troubl e in math?â€
Hereâ€™ s the advice from a child with the growth mindset:
Do you quit a lot? Do you think  for a minute and then stop? If you
do, you should think for a long timeâ€”two minutes maybe and if you
canâ€™ t ge t it you should read the problem again. If you canâ€™ t get it
then, you should raise your hand and ask the teacher .
Isnâ€™ t that the greatest? The advice from children with the fixed mindset
was not nearly as useful. Since  thereâ€™ s no recipe for success in the fixed
mindset, their advice tended to  be short and sweet. â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€ was the
advice of one child as he of fered his condolences.
Even babies  can pass along the messages theyâ€™ve received. Mary Main
and Carol Geor ge studied abused children, who had been judged and
punished by their parents for crying or making a fuss. Abusive p arents often
donâ€™ t un derstand that childrenâ€™ s  crying is a signal of their ne eds, or that
babies canâ€™ t stop crying on co mmand. Instead, they judge the child as
disobedient, willful, or bad for crying.
Main and Geor ge watched the abused children (who were one to three
years old ) in their day care setti ng, observing how they reacted when other
children were in distress and c rying. The abused children often became
angry at the distressed children, and some even tried to assault them. They
had gotten the message that children who cry are to be judged and
punished.
W e often think that the legacy of abuse gets passed on to others only
when th e victims of abuse become parents. But this amazing study shows
that children learn lessons early and they act on them.
How did non abused children react to their distressed classmate, by the
way? Th ey show ed sympathy . Many went over to the crying child to see
what was wrong and to see if they could help out.
ISNâ€™T DISCIPLINE TEACHING?Many pa rents think that when th ey judge and punish, they ar e  teaching, as
in â€œIâ€™ll teach you a lesson you â€™ll never for get.â€ What are the y teaching?
They are  teaching their children that if they go against the pare ntsâ€™ rules or
values, theyâ€™ll be judged and pu nished. Theyâ€™re not teaching their children
how to think through the issues and come to ethical, mature d ecisions on
their own.
And chances are, theyâ€™re not tea ching their children that the cha nnels of
communication are open.
Sixteen-year -old Alyssa came t o her mother and said that she and her
friends w anted to try alcohol. C ould she invite them over for  a â€œcocktail
partyâ€? On the face of it, this might seem outrageous. But hereâ€™ s what
Alyssa m eant. S he and her frien ds had been going to parties where alcohol
was available, but they didnâ€™ t want to try it in a setting where they didnâ€™ t
feel safe and in control. They also didnâ€™ t want to drive home after drinking.
They wa nted to try it in a supervised setting, with their parentsâ€™ permission,
where their parents could come and pick them up afterward.
It doesn â€™ t matte r whether Alyssaâ€™ s parents said yes or no. They had a
full disc ussion of the issues involved. They had a far more instructive
discussion than what would ha ve followed from an outraged, angry , and
judgmental dismissal.
Itâ€™ s not that growth-minded par ents indulge and coddle their c hildren.
Not at all. They set high standar ds, but they teach the children how to reach
them. Th ey say no, but itâ€™ s a fair , thoughtful, and respectful no . Next time
youâ€™re in a position to discipline, ask yourself, What is the message Iâ€™m
sending here: I w ill judge and  punish you ? Or I wi ll help you think and
learn ?
MINDSETS CAN BE A LIFE-AND-DEA TH MA TTER
Of cour se parents want the bes t for their children, but sometimes parents
put t heir children in danger . As the director of under graduate studies for my
department at Columbia, I saw a  lot of students in trouble. Here is the story
of a great kid who almost didnâ€™ t make it.
Sandy sh owed up in my of fice at Columbia one week before gra duation.
She wan ted to change her major to psychology . This is basically a wacky
request, but I s ensed her desperation and listened carefully t o her story .When I looked over her record,  it was filled with A+â€™ s and Fâ€™ s . What was
going on?
Sandy had been groomed by her parents to go to Harvard. Because of
their fix ed mind set, the only go al of Sandyâ€™ s education was t o prove her
worth and competence (and perhaps theirs) by gaining ad mission to
Harvard. Going there would mea n that she was truly intelligent. For them, it
was not about le arning. It was no t about pursuing her love of science. It was
not even  about making a great contribution. It was about the label. But she
didnâ€™ t ge t in. And she fell into a  depression that had plagued her  ever since.
Sometimes she managed to wor k ef fectively (the A+â€™ s), but som etimes she
did not (the Fâ€™ s).
I knew that if I didnâ€™ t help her she wouldnâ€™ t graduate, and if she didnâ€™ t
graduate she wouldnâ€™ t be able t o face her parents. And if she couldnâ€™ t face
her parents, I didnâ€™ t know what would happen.
I wa s le gitimately able to help Sandy graduate, but that isnâ€™ t re ally the
point. Itâ€™ s a real tragedy to take a  brilliant and wonderful kid like Sandy and
crush her with the weight of these labels.
I ho pe these st ories will teach parents to â€œwant the bestâ€ f or their
children in the right wayâ€”by fostering their interests, growth, and learning.
W ANTING THE BEST IN THE WORST W A Y
Letâ€™ s look more closely at the message from Sandyâ€™ s parents: W e donâ€™ t car e
about wh o you ar e, what youâ€™r e inter ested in, and what you can become. W e
donâ€™ t car e about learning. W e w ill love and r espect you only if you go to
Harvar d.
Markâ€™ s parents felt the same way . Mark was an exceptional math
student, and as he finished junior high he was excited about going to
Stuyvesant High  School, a spec ial high school in New Y ork with a strong
math-and-science curriculum. There, he would study math w ith the best
teachers and talk math with the most advanced students in the city .
Stuyvesant also had a program that would let him take college math courses
at Columbia as soon as he was ready .
But at the last moment, his parents would not let him go. They had
heard that it was hard to get into Harvard from Stuyvesant. So they made
him go to a dif ferent high school.It d idnâ€™ t matter that he wouldnâ€™ t be able to pursue his inte rests or
develop his talents as well. Only one thing mattered, and it starts with an H .
â€œWE LOVE YOUâ€”ON OUR TERMSâ€
Itâ€™ s not just Iâ€™m judging you.  Itâ€™ s Iâ€™m judging you and Iâ€™ll only love you if
you succeedâ€”on my terms.
W eâ€™ve studied kids ranging fro m six years old to college age. Those
with the  fixed mindset feel their parents wonâ€™ t love and respect them unless
they fulfill their parentsâ€™ aspirations for them. The college students say:
â€œI often feel like my parents wonâ€™ t value me if Iâ€™m not as successful as
they would like.â€
Or: â€œMy parents say I can be an ything I like, but deep down I f eel they
wonâ€™ t approve of me unless I pursue a profession they admire.â€
John McEnroeâ€™ s father was like that. He was judgmentalâ€”everything
was black-and-w hiteâ€”and he put on the pressure. â€œMy parents pushed me.
. . . My dad was the one mainly . He seemed to live for my growing little
junior ca reer . . . . I remember t elling my dad that I wasnâ€™ t enjoying it. Iâ€™d
say , â€˜Do  you have to come to every match? Do you have to come to this
practice? Canâ€™ t you take one of f?â€™ â€
McEnroe brought his father the success he craved, but McEnroe didnâ€™ t
enjoy a moment of it. He says he enjoyed the consequences  of his success
â€”being at the to p, the adulation, and the money . However , he s ays, â€œMany
athletes seem truly to love to play their sport. I donâ€™ t think I ever felt that
way about tennis.â€
I think he did love it at the very beginning, because he talks about how
at fi rst h e was fascinated by all the dif ferent ways you could hit a ball and
create n ew shot s. But we never  hear about that kind of fascination again.
Mr . McEnroe saw his boy was g ood at tennis and on went the pressure, the
judgment, and the love that depended on his sonâ€™ s success.
T iger W oodsâ€™ s father presents a contrast. Thereâ€™ s no doubt that this guy
is am bitious. He also sees his son as a chosen person with a God-given
destiny , but he fostered T iger â€™ s  love of golf and raised T iger to focus on
growth and learning. â€œIf T iger had wanted to be a plumber , I wouldnâ€™ t have
minded, as long as he was a hell of a plumber . The goal was for him to be a
good pe rson. He â€™ s a great perso n.â€ T iger says in return, â€œMy parents havebeen the  biggest influence in my  life. They taught me to give of  myself, my
time, talent, and, most of all, my love.â€ This shows that yo u can have
superinvolved parents who still  foster the child â€™ s own gr owth,  rather than
replacing it with their own pressure and judgments.
Dorothy DeLay , the famous violin teacher , encountered pressure -cooker
parents a ll the time. Parents who cared more about talent, image, and labels
than about the childâ€™ s long-term learning.
One set of parents brought their eight-year -old boy to play for DeLay .
Despite her warnings, they had  made him memorize the Beeth oven violin
concerto. He was note-perfect, but he played like a frightened robot. They
had, in fact, ruined his playing to suit their idea of talent, as in, â€œMy eight-
year -old can play the Beethoven violin concerto. What can yours do?â€
DeLay s pent cou ntless hours with a mother who insisted it was time for
her son to be signed by a fa ncy talent agency . But had she followed
DeLayâ€™ s advice? No. For quite a while, DeLay had been warning her that
her son didnâ€™ t have a lar ge en ough repertoire. Rather than heeding the
expert advice and fostering he r sonâ€™ s development, however , the mother
refused to believe that anyone could turn down a talent like his for such a
slight reason.
In sharp  contras t was Y ura Leeâ€™ s mother . Mrs. Lee always sat serenely
during Y uraâ€™ s le sson, without the tension and frantic note taking  of some of
the o ther parents. She smiled, she swayed to the music, she enjo yed herself.
As a result, Y ura did not develop the anxieties and insecurities that children
with overinvested, judgmental parents do. Says Y ura, â€œIâ€™m always happy
when I play .â€
IDEALS
Isnâ€™ t it natural f or parents to set goals and have ideals for their children?
Y es, but some ideals are helpful and others are not. W e as ked college
students to descri be their ideal of a successful student. And we asked th em
to tell us how they thought they measured up to that ideal.
Students with the fixed mindset described ideals that could not be
worked toward. Y ou had it or you didnâ€™ t.
â€œThe ideal successful student is one who comes in with innate talent.â€â€œGenius, physic ally fit and good at sports. . . . They got there b ased on
natural ability .â€
Did they think they measured up to their ideal? Mostly not. Instead,
they said these ideals disrupted their thinking, made them procrastinate,
made the m give up, and made them stressed-out. They were demoralized by
the ideal they could never hope to be.
Students with the growth mindset described ideals like these:
â€œA succ essful student is one w hose primary goal is to expand their
knowledge and their ways of thinking and investigating the wor ld. They do
not see grades as an end in themselves but as means to continue to grow .â€
Or: â€œThe  ideal student values knowledge for its own sake, as we ll as for
its in strumental uses. He or she hopes to make a contribution t o society at
lar ge.â€
W ere they similar to their ideal? They were working toward it. â€œAs
similar a s I can b eâ€”hey , it takes ef fort.â€ Or: â€œI believed for man y years that
grades/tests wer e the most impo rtant thing but I am trying to m ove beyond
that.â€ Their ideals were inspiring to them.
When p arents give their children a fixed-mindset ideal, they are asking
them to fit the mold of the brilliant, talented child, or be deeme d unworthy .
There is no ro om for error . And there is no room for the  childrenâ€™ s
individualityâ€”their interests, their quirks, their desires and v alues. I can
hardly c ount the times fixed-mindset parents have wrung their hands and
told me how their children were rebelling or dropping out.
Haim Ginott describes Nicholas, age seventeen:
In my father â€™ s mind there is a picture of an ideal son. Whe n he
compares him to me, he is deeply disappointed. I donâ€™ t live up to my
father â€™ s dream. Since early childhood, I sensed his disappointment.
He tried  to hide it, but it came out in a hundred little waysâ€”in his
tone, in his word s, in his silence . He tried hard to make me a carbon
copy of his drea ms. When he fa iled he gave up on me. But he left a
deep scar , a permanent feeling of failure.
When parents help their children construct growth-minded ideals, they
are givin g them  something they can strive for . They are also giving their
children growin g room, room to grow into full human beings who willmake th eir contr ibution to society in a way that excites them. I have rarely
heard a growth-minded parent  say , â€œI am disappointed in my child.â€
Instead, with a beaming smile,  they say , â€œI am amazed at th e incredible
person my child has become.â€
Everything Iâ€™ve said about parents applies to teachers, too. But teachers
have additional concerns. They face lar ge classes of students with dif fering
skills, whose past learning theyâ€™ve had no part in. Whatâ€™ s the best way to
educate these students?
TEACHERS (AND P ARENTS): WHA T MAKES A GREA T TEACHER (OR
P ARENT)?
Many educators  think that lowering their standards will give students
success experiences, boost their self-esteem, and raise their achievement. It
comes from the same philosophy as the overpraising of studentsâ€™
intelligence. W ell, it doesnâ€™ t work. Lowering standards just leads to poorly
educated students who feel entitled to easy work and lavish praise.
For thirty-five years, Sheila Schwartz taught aspiring English teachers.
She tried to set high standards, especially since they were going  to pass on
their knowledge to generations  of children. But they became indignant.
â€œOne student, whose writing was full of grammatical mistakes and
misspellings,â€ she says, â€œmarch ed into my of fice with her husband from
W est Pointâ€”in a dress uniform, his chest covered with ribbonsâ€”because
her feelings had been hurt by my insistence on correct spelling.â€
Another student was asked to summarize the theme of T o Kill a
Mockingbir d,  Harper Leeâ€™ s novel about a southern lawyer fighting prejudice
and (uns uccessfully) defending a  black man accused of murder . The student
insisted the theme was that â€œall people are basically nice.â€ Whe n Schwartz
questioned that conclusion, the student left the class and reported her to the
dean. Sc hwartz was reprimande d for having standards that were too high.
Why , Sc hwartz asks, should the low standards of these future teachers be
honored above the needs of the children they will one day teach?
On the other h and, simply raising standards in our schools, without
giving students the means of re aching them, is a recipe for disaster . It just
pushes the poorly prepared or po orly motivated students into failure and out
of school.Is there a way to set standards high and  have students reach them?
In chapter 3 , we saw in the work of Falko Rheinber g that teachers with
the grow th mindset brought many low achievers up into the high-achieving
range. W e saw in the growth-minded teaching of Jaime Escalante that inner -
city high school students could learn college calculus, and in the growth-
minded teaching of Marva Collins that inner -city grade school children
could read Shakespeare. In this chapter , weâ€™ll see more. W eâ€™ll see how
growth-oriented teaching unleashes childrenâ€™ s minds.
Iâ€™ll f ocus on three great teache rs, two who worked with stude nts who
are considered â€œdisadvantagedâ€ and one who worked with students
considered supertalented. What do these great teachers have in common?
Great T eachers
The gr ea t teachers believe in the gr owth of the intellect and tale nt, and they
ar e fascinated with the pr ocess of learning.
Marva Collins taught Chicago  children who had been judged and
discarded. For many , her classro om was their last stop. One boy had been in
and out of thirteen schools in fo ur years. One stabbed children with pencils
and had been thrown out of a mental health center . One eight-year -old
would remove the blade from  the pencil sharpener and cut up his
classmatesâ€™ coats, hats, gloves, and scarves. One child referred to killing
himself in almost every sentence . One hit another student with a hammer on
his f irst day . These children ha dnâ€™ t learned much in school, b ut everyone
knew it was their own fault. Everyone but Collins.
When 60 Minutes  did a segment on Collinsâ€™ s classroom, Morley Safer
tried his best to get a child to say he didnâ€™ t like the school. â€œItâ€™ s so hard
here. Th ereâ€™ s no  recess. Thereâ€™ s no gym. They work you all day . Y ou have
only for ty minutes for lunch. Wh y do you like it? Itâ€™ s just too hard.â€ But the
student replied, â€œThatâ€™ s why I like it, because it makes your brains bigger .â€
Chicago Sun-T imes  writer Zay Smith interviewed one of the children:
â€œW e do hard things here. They fill your brain.â€
As Colli ns looks back on how she got started, she says, â€œI have  always
been fascinated with learning, with the pr ocess  of discovering something
new , an d it was exciting to share in the discoveries made by my . . .students.â€ On the first day of sch ool, she always promised her studentsâ€”all
studentsâ€”that they would learn. She for ged a contract with them.
â€œI know most of you canâ€™ t spell your name. Y ou donâ€™ t know the
alphabet, you donâ€™ t know how to read, you donâ€™ t know homonyms or how
to syllab icate. I promise you th at you will. None of you has ever failed.
School may have failed you. W e ll, goodbye to failure, children. W elcome to
success. Y ou will read hard books in here and understand what you read.
Y ou will write e very day . . . . But you must help me to help you. If you
donâ€™ t give anything, donâ€™ t expect anything. Success is not coming to you,
you must come to it.â€
Her joy in her studentsâ€™ learning  was enormous. As they chang ed from
children who arrived with â€œtoughened faces and glassed-over eyesâ€ to
children who were beginning to brim with enthusiasm, she to ld them, â€œI
donâ€™ t kn ow what St. Peter has planned for me, but you children  are giving
me my heaven on earth.â€
Rafe Esquith teaches Los Ang eles second graders from poor areas
plagued with crime. Many live with people who have drug, alcohol, and
emotional probl ems. Every day he tells his students that he is  no smarter
than they areâ€”just more experi enced. He constantly makes them see how
much they have grown intellectuallyâ€”how assignments that were once
hard have become easier because of their practice and discipline.
Unlike Collinsâ€™ s school or Esquithâ€™ s school, the Juilliard School of
music ac cepts on ly the most tale nted students in the world. Y ou would think
the idea would be, Y ouâ€™r e all talented, now letâ€™ s get down to learning.  But if
anything, the idea of talent and genius looms even lar ger there. In fact,
many te achers mentally weede d out the students they werenâ€™ t going to
bother with. Except for Doroth y DeLay , the wondrous violin teacher of
Itzhak Perlman, Midori, and Sarah Chang.
DeLayâ€™ s husband always teased  her about her â€œmidwesternâ€ belief that
anything is possible. â€œHere is the empty prairieâ€”letâ€™ s build a city .â€ Thatâ€™ s
exactly why she loved teaching. For her , teaching was about watching
something grow before her very eyes. And the challenge was to figure out
how to make it happen. If students didnâ€™ t play in tune, it was because they
hadnâ€™ t learned how .
Her men tor and fellow teacher at Juilliard, Ivan Galamian, would say ,
â€œOh, he has no  ear . Donâ€™ t waste your time.â€ But she would insist onexperimenting w ith dif ferent ways of changing that. ( How  can  I do it?) An d
she usually found a way . As more and more students wanted a part of this
mindset and as she â€œwastedâ€ m ore and more of her time on these ef forts,
Galamian tried to get the president of Juilliard to fire her .
Itâ€™ s interesting. Both DeLay and Galamian valued talent, but Galamian
believed that talent was inborn a nd DeLay believed that it was a quality that
could be  acquire d. â€œI think itâ€™ s too easy for a teacher to say , â€˜Oh this child
wasnâ€™ t b orn with it, so I wonâ€™ t waste my time.â€™ T oo many te achers hide
their own lack of ability behind that statement.â€
DeLay g ave her  all to every one of her students. Itzhak Perlman was her
student and so w as his wife, T ob y , who says that very few teachers get even
a fractio n of an I tzhak Perlman in a lifetime. â€œShe got the whole  thing, but I
donâ€™ t believe she gave him mor e than she gave me . . . and I believe I am
just one  of many , many such  people.â€ Once DeLay was asked, about
another student,  why she gave so much time to a pupil who showed so little
promise. â€œI think she has somet hing special. . . . Itâ€™ s in her person. There is
some kind of dig nity .â€ If DeLay could get her to put it into her p laying, that
student would be a special violinist.
High Standards and a Nurturing Atmosphere
Great tea chers set high standards for all their students, not just th e ones who
are alrea dy ach ieving. Marva Collins set extremely high standards, right
from the  start. She introduced words and concepts that were, at first, way
above w hat her students could grasp. Y et she established on Day One an
atmosphere of genuine af fection  and concern as she promised students they
would p roduce: â€œIâ€™m gonna love you . . . I love you already , and Iâ€™m going
to love you even when you don â€™ t love yourself,â€ she said to the boy who
wouldnâ€™ t try .
Do teach ers hav e to love all of their students? No, but they have to care
about every single student.
T eachers with the fixed mindset  create an atmosphere of judgin g. These
teachers look at studentsâ€™ beginning performance and decide whoâ€™ s smart
and who â€™ s dumb. Then they give up on the â€œdumbâ€ ones. â€œThe yâ€™re not my
responsibility .â€These teachers donâ€™ t believe in improvement, so they donâ€™ t try to create
it. Remember the fixed-mindset teachers in chapter 3  who said:
â€œAccording to my experience studentsâ€™ achievement mostly remains
constant in the course of a year .â€
â€œAs a teacher I have no influence on studentsâ€™ intellectual ability .â€
This is how stereotypes work. Stereotypes tell teachers which  groups
are brig ht and which groups are not. So teachers with the fix ed mindset
know which students to give up on before theyâ€™ve even met them.
More on High Standards and a Nurturing Atmosphere
When Benjamin Bloom studied his 120 world-class concert pianists,
sculptors, swimmers, tennis players, mathematicians, and research
neurologists, he  found something fascinating. For most of them, their first
teachers were incredibly warm  and accepting. Not that they set low
standards. Not at all, but they cr eated an atmosphere of trust, no t judgment.
It was, â€œIâ€™m going to teach you,â€ not â€œIâ€™m going to judge your talent.â€
As you look at w hat Collins and Esquith demanded of their studentsâ€”
all their students â€”itâ€™ s almost shocking. When Collins expanded  her school
to in clude young children, she re quired that every four -year -old who started
in Septe mber be  reading by Ch ristmas. And they all were. The  three- and
four -year -olds u sed a vocabulary book titled V ocabulary for the High
School Student.  T he seven-year -olds were reading The W al l Str eet Journal.
For older children, a discussion of Platoâ€™ s Republic  led to discussions of de
T ocquevilleâ€™ s Democracy in America,  Orwellâ€™ s Animal Farm,  Machiavelli,
and the Chicago city council. Her reading list for the late-grade-school
children included The Complete Plays of Anton C hekhov , Physics Thr ough
Experiment,  and The Canterbury T ales.  Oh,  and always  Shakespeare. Even
the boys who picked their teeth with switchblades, she says, loved
Shakespeare and always begged for more.
Y et Coll ins maintained an extremely nurturing atmosphere. A very strict
and disciplined one, but a lov ing one. Realizing that her stu dents were
coming from teachers who mad e a career of telling them what was wrong
with the m, she quickly made known her complete commitment to them as
her students and as people.Esquith bemoans the lowering of standards. Recently , he tells us, his
school celebrate d reading scores that were twenty points below the national
average. Why? Because they were a point or two higher than the year
before. â€œ Maybe itâ€™ s important to look for the good and be opt imistic,â€ he
says, â€œb ut delus ion is not the answer . Those who celebrate fail ure will not
be aroun d to help todayâ€™ s studen ts celebrate their jobs flipping bur gers. . . .
Someone has to tell children if t hey are behind, and lay out a pl an of attack
to help them catch up.â€
All of his fifth graders master a reading list that includes Of Mice and
Men, Na tive Son, Bury My Hear t at W ounded Knee, The Joy Luck Club, The
Diary of Anne Frank, T o Kill a Mockingbir d,  and A Separate Peace.  Every
one of his sixth graders passes an algebra final that would r educe most
eighth and ninth graders to tears. But again, all is achieved in an atmosphere
of af fection and deep personal commitment to every student.
â€œChallenge and nurtureâ€ describ es DeLayâ€™ s approach, too. One of her
former students expresses it this way: â€œThat is part of Miss DeLayâ€™ s genius
â€”to put people in the frame of mind where they can do their best. . . . V ery
few teachers can actually get y ou to your ultimate potential. M iss DeLay
has that gift. Sh e challenges you at the same time that you feel you are
being nurtured.â€
Hard W ork and More Hard W ork
But are challenge and love en ough? Not quite. All great teachers teach
students how  t o reach  the high standards. Collins and Esquith didnâ€™ t hand
their students a reading list and wish them bon voyage.  Collinsâ€™ s students
read and discussed every line of Macbeth  in clas s. Esqui th spent hours
planning what chapters they wo uld read in class. â€œI know which child will
handle t he challenge of the most dif ficult paragraphs, and care fully plan a
passage for the shy youngster . . . who will begin his journey as a good
reader . Nothing is left to chance. . . . It takes enormous ener gy , but to be in a
room wi th young minds who ha ng on every word of a classic bo ok and beg
for more if I stop makes all the planning worthwhile.â€
What are they teaching the stu dents en route? T o love learn ing. T o
eventually learn  and think for themselves. And to work h ard on the
fundamentals. Esquithâ€™ s class of ten met before school, after school, and onschool vacations to master the fundamentals of English and math, especially
as the work got harder . His motto: â€œThere are no shortcuts.â€ Collins echoes
that idea  as she tells her class, â€œThere is no magic here. Mrs. Collins is no
miracle worker . I do not walk on water , I do not part the sea. I just love
children and work harder than a lot of people, and so will you.â€
DeLay expected a lot from her students, but she, too, guided them there.
Most students are intimidated b y the idea of talent, and it keeps them in a
fixed mindset. But DeLay dem ystified talent. One student was sure he
couldnâ€™ t play a piece as fast as I tzhak Perlman. So she didnâ€™ t let him see the
metronome unti l he had achieved it. â€œI know so surely that if he had been
handling that metronome, as he approached that number he wou ld have said
to himself, I can  never do this as fast as Itzhak Perlman, and he would have
stopped himself.â€
Another student was intimidated by the beautiful sound made by
talented violinists. â€œW e were working on my sound, and there was this one
note I played, and Miss DeLa y stopped me and said, â€˜Now  that  is a
beautiful sound.â€™ â€ She then explained how every note has to have a
beautiful beginning, middle, and end, leading into the next no te. And he
thought, â€œW ow! If I can do it th ere, I can do it everywhere.â€ Suddenly the
beautiful sound of Perlman mad e sense and was not just an overwhelming
concept.
When st udents d onâ€™ t know how to do something and others do, the gap
seems unbridgeable. Some edu cators try to reassure their students that
theyâ€™re j ust fine as they are. Growth-minded teachers tell stude nts the truth
and then give them the tools to close the gap. As Marva Collins said to a
boy who was clowning around in class, â€œY ou are in sixth grade and your
reading score is 1.1. I donâ€™ t hide your scores in a folder . I tell them to you
so you know what you have to do. Now your clowning days are over .â€ Then
they got down to work.
Students Who Donâ€™ t Care
What about students who wonâ€™ t work, who donâ€™ t care to learn? Here is a
shortened versio n of an interaction between Collins and Gary , a student
who refused to w ork, ripped up his homework assignments, an d would notparticipate in class. Collins is try ing to get him to go to the blackboard to do
some problems:
C OLLINS:  Sweetheart, what are you going to do? Use your life or throw
it away?
G AR Y :  Iâ€™m not gonna do any damn work.
C OLLINS:  I am not going to give up on you. I am not going to let you
give up on yourself. If you sit th ere leaning against this wall all day , you
are g oing to end up leaning on something or someone all your life. And
all that brilliance bottled up inside you will go to waste.
At that, Gary ag reed to go to the board, but then refused to add ress the
work there. After a while Collins said:
â€œIf y ou do not want to participate, go to the telephone and tell your
mother , â€˜Mother , in this school we have to learn, and Mrs. Co llins says I
canâ€™ t fool around, so will you please pick me up.â€™ â€
Gary started writing. Eventually , Gary became an eager participant and
an a vid writer . L ater that year , the class was discussing Macbeth and how
his m isguided thinking led him to commit murder . â€œItâ€™ s sort of l ike Socrates
says, isnâ€™ t it, Miss Collins?â€ Ga ry piped up. â€œMacbeth should h ave known
that â€˜Str aight thi nking leads to s traight living.â€™ â€ For a class assignment, he
wrote, â€œSomnus , god of sleep, please awaken us. While we sleep, ignorance
takes over the world. . . . T ake your spell of f us. W e donâ€™ t have long before
ignorance makes a coup dâ€™Ã©tat of the world.â€
When te achers are judging them, students will sabotage the teacher by
not t rying. But w hen students understand that school is for themâ€”a way for
them to grow their mindsâ€”they do not insist on sabotaging themselves.
In my work, I have seen tough guys shed tears when they real ize they
can become smarter . Itâ€™ s common for students to turn of f to school and
adopt an air of indif ference, but  we make a mistake if we think any student
stops caring.
Growth-Minded T eachers: Who  Ar e  These People?
How can  growth-minded teache rs be so selfless, devoting untold hours to
the worst students? Are they just saints? Is it reasonable to expect thateveryone can become a saint? The answer is that theyâ€™re not entirely
selfless. They love to learn. And teaching is a wonderful way to learn.
About people and how they tick. About what you teach. About yourself.
And about life.
Fixed-minded teachers often think of themselves as finished products.
Their ro le is simply to impart th eir knowledge. But doesnâ€™ t that get boring
year afte r year? Standing before  yet another crowd of faces and imparting.
Now , thatâ€™ s hard.
Seymour Saraso n was a professor of mine when I was in graduate
school. He was a wonderful educator , and he always told us to question
assumptions. â€œT hereâ€™ s an assumption,â€ he said, â€œthat schools are for
studentsâ€™ learning. W ell, why arenâ€™ t they just as much for teachersâ€™
learning?â€ I never for got that. I n all of my teaching, I think a bout what I
find fascinating and what I  w ould love to  learn more about. I use my
teaching to grow , and that make s me, even after all these years, a fresh and
eager teacher .
One of Marva C ollinsâ€™ s first mentors taught her the same thingâ€”that,
above a ll, a good teacher is one who continues to learn along with the
students. And she let her students know that right up front: â€œS ometimes I
donâ€™ t like other grown-ups ve ry much because they think they know
everything. I donâ€™ t know everything. I can learn all the time.â€
Itâ€™ s been said that Dorothy DeLay was an extraordinary teacher because
she was not interested in teaching. She was interested in learning.
So, are great teachers born or made? Can anyone be a Collins, Esquith,
or DeLa y? It starts with the growth mindsetâ€”about yoursel f and about
children. Not just lip service to  the idea that all children can learn, but a
deep desire to re ach in and igni te the mind of every child. Michael Lewis,
in The New Y ork T imes,  tells of a coach who did this for him. â€œI had a new
taste for  . . . extra work . . . and it didnâ€™ t take long to figure out how much
better my life could be if I applied this new zeal acquired on a baseball field
to the rest of it. It was as if this baseball coach had reached inside me, found
a rusty switch marked T urn On Before Attempting to Use and flipped it.â€
Coaches are teachers, too, but th eir studentsâ€™ successes and failures are
played o ut in front of crowds, pu blished in the newspapers, and written into
the record books. Their jobs rest on producing winners. Letâ€™ s look closely at
three legendary coaches to see their mindsets in action.COACHES: WINNING THROUGH MINDSET
Everyone who knows me well l aughs when I say someone is c omplicated.
â€œWhat do you th ink of so-and-so?â€ â€œOh, heâ€™ s complicated.â€ Itâ€™ s  usually not
a co mpliment. It means that s o-and-so may be capable of g reat charm,
warmth, and generosity , but thereâ€™ s an undercurrent of ego that can erupt at
any time. Y ou never really know when you can trust him.
The fixed mindset makes people complicated. It makes them worried
about th eir fixed  traits and create s the need to document them, sometimes at
your expense. And it makes them judgmental.
The Fixed-Mindset Coach in Action
Bobby Knight, the famous and controversial college basketball coach, is
complicated. He  could be unbelievably kind. One time he passed up an
important and lucrative opportu nity to be a sportscaster , because a former
player of his had been in a bad accident. Knight rushed to his s ide and saw
him through the ordeal.
He could be extremely gracious. After the basketball team he coached
won the Olympic gold medal, he insisted that the team pay homage first and
foremost to Coach Henry Iba. Iba had never been given proper respect for
his Oly mpic accomplishments, and in whatever way he could, Knight
wanted to make up for it. He had the team carry Coach Iba arou nd the floor
on their shoulders.
Knight c ared greatly about his playersâ€™ academic records. He wanted
them to get an e ducation, and he had a firm rule against missin g classes or
tutoring sessions.
But he could also be cruel, and this cruelty came from the fixed
mindset. John Feinstein, autho r of Season on the Brink,  a book  about
Knight and his team, tells us: â€œ Knight was incapable of accepting failure.
Every defeat was personal; his  tea m lost, a team he  had  selected and
coached. . . . Failure on any leve l all but destroyed him, especially failure in
coaching because it was coaching that gave him his identity , made him
special, set him apart.â€ A loss m ade him a failure, obliterated his identity .
So when  he was your coachâ€”when your wins and losses measured himâ€”he w as mercilessly judgmental . His demeaning of players w ho let him
down was, hopefully , without parallel.
In D aryl Thomas, Feinstein s ays, â€œKnight saw a player of huge
potential. Thom as had what coa ches call a â€˜million dollar body .â€™ â€ He was
big and strong, but also fast. He could shoot the ball with his left hand or
his right  hand. Knight couldnâ€™ t live with the thought that Thomas and his
million-dollar body werenâ€™ t bringing the team success:
â€œY ou know what you are Dary l? Y ou are the worst f pussy I â€™ve ever
seen pla y basket ball at this scho ol. The absolute worst pussy eve r . Y ou have
more goddam ability than 95 pe rcent of the players weâ€™ve had here but you
are a pussy fro m the top of your head to the bottom of yo ur feet. An
absolute f pussy . Thatâ€™ s my assessment of you after three years.â€
T o make a similar point, Knight once put a T ampax in a player â€™ s locker .
Thomas was a s ensitive guy . An assistant coach had given this advice:
When h eâ€™ s calli ng you an assho le, donâ€™ t listen. But when he starts telling
you why  you â€™re an assh ole, listen. That way , youâ€™ll get better . Thom as
couldnâ€™ t follow that advice. He heard everything, and, after th e tirade, he
broke down right there on the basketball court.
The ax of judgm ent came down on players who had the audacity  to lose
a ga me. Often Knight did not let the guilty parties ride back ho me with the
rest of the team. They were no longer worthy of respectful treatment. One
time, after his team reached the semifinals of a national tournament (but not
the  national tournament), he was asked by an interviewer what he liked best
about the team. â€œWhat I like best about this team right no w ,â€ Knight
answered, â€œis the fact that I only have to watch it play one more time.â€
Some pl ayers could take it better than others. Steve Alford, who went
on t o have a professional caree r , had come to Indiana with clear goals in
mind an d was able to maintain a  strong growth focus much of the time. He
was able  to hear and use Knightâ€™ s wisdom and, for the most par t, ignore the
obscene or demeaning parts of the tirades. But even he describes how the
team broke down under the y oke of Knightâ€™ s judgments, and how he
himself became so personally unhappy at some points that he lost his zest
for the sport.
â€œThe atm osphere was poisonous. . . . When I had been playing well I
had alwa ys stayed upbeat, no m atter how much Coach yelled. .  . . But nowhis nega tivism, piled on top of my own, was drowning me. . .  . Mom and
Dad were concerned. They could see the love of the game going out of me.â€
THE HOL Y GRAIL: NO MIST AKES
Says Alford, â€œCoachâ€™ s Holy Grail was the mistake-free game.â€ Uh-oh. W e
know which mindset makes mistakes intolerable. And Knightâ€™ s explosions
were legendary . There was the time he threw the chair across the court.
There w as the time he yanked h is player of f the court by his je rsey . There
was the time he grabbed his player by the neck. He often tried to justify his
behavior by saying he was toughening the team up, preparing them to play
under pr essure. But the truth is, he couldnâ€™ t control himself. W as the chair a
teaching exercise? W as the chokehold educational?
He motivated his players, not through respect for them, but through
intimidationâ€”through fear . They feared his judgments and explosions. Did
it work?
Sometimes it â€œworked.â€ He had three championship teams.  In the
â€œseason on the brinkâ€ described  by John Feinstein, the team did not have
size, experience, or quickness, but they were contenders. They won twenty-
one games, thanks to Knightâ€™ s  great basketball knowledge and coaching
skills.
But other times, it didnâ€™ t work. Individual players or the team as a
whole b roke dow n. In the season on the brink, they collapsed a t the end of
the season. The year before, to o, the team had collapsed und er Knightâ€™ s
pressure. Over the years, some players had escaped by transferr ing to other
schools, by breaking the rules (like cutting classes or skipping tutoring
sessions), or by going early to the pros, like Isiah Thomas. On a world tour ,
the players often sat around fant asizing about where they should  have gone
to school, if they hadnâ€™ t made the mistake of choosing Indiana.
Itâ€™ s not that Knight had a fixed  mindset about his playersâ€™ ab ility . He
firmly b elieved in their capacity to develop. But he had a fix ed mindset
about hi mself an d his coaching ability . The team was his product, and they
had to prove hi s ability every time out. They were not allowed to lose
games, make mistakes, or ques tion him in any way , because  that would
reflect o n his competence. Nor did he seem to analyze his m otivationalstrategies when they werenâ€™ t working. Maybe Daryl Thomas needed
another kind of incentive aside from ridicule or humiliation.
What ar e we to make of this c omplicated man as a mentor t o young
players? His biggest star , Isiah Thomas, expresses his profound
ambivalence about Knight. â€œY ou know there were times when if I had a
gun, I think I would have shot him. And there were other times when I
wanted to put my arms around him, hug him, and tell him I loved him.â€
I w ould not con sider myself an unqualified success if my best student
had considered shooting me.
The Growth-Mindset Coach in Action
A COACH FOR ALL SEASONS
Coach John W ooden produced o ne of the greatest championships records in
sports. He led the UCLA baske tball team to the NCAA Cham pionship in
1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1975. There
were seasons when his team was undefeated, and they once had an eighty-
eight-game winning streak. All this I sort of knew .
What I didnâ€™ t kn ow was that when W ooden arrived at UCLA, it was a
far c ry from a basketball dynast y . In fact, he didnâ€™ t want to wo rk at UCLA
at al l. He wanted  to go to Minnesota. It was arranged that Minn esota would
phone him at six oâ€™clock on a certain evening to tell him if he had the job.
He told UCLA to call him at seven. No one called at six, six thirty , or even
six forty -five, so  when UCLA called at seven, he said yes. No sooner had
he hung up than  the call from Minnesota came. A storm had me ssed up the
phone lines and prevented the si x oâ€™clock phone call with the job of fer from
getting through.
UCLA had grossly inadequate facilities. For his first sixteen years,
W ooden held practice in a cr owded, dark, and poorly ventilated gym,
known a s the B.O. Barn because of the atmospheric ef fect of t he sweating
bodies. In the same gym, there were often wrestling matches, gymnastics
training, tramp oline jumping, and cheerleading workouts going on
alongside basketball practice.
There w as also no place for the games. For the first few years, they had
to use the B.O. Barn, and then for fourteen more years, they h ad to travelaround the region borrowing gyms from schools and towns.
Then there were the players. When he put them through their first
practice, he was shattered. They were so bad that if heâ€™d had an honorable
way to back ou t of the job, he would have. The press had (perceptively)
picked h is team to finish last in their division, but W ooden went to work,
and this  laughable team did not finish last. It won the divisio n title, with
twenty-two wins  and seven loss es for the season. The next year , they went
to the NCAA play-of fs.
What di d he give them? He ga ve them constant training in th e basic
skills, he gave them conditioning, and he gave them mindset.
THE HOL Y GRAIL: FULL PREP ARA TION AND FULL EFFOR T
W ooden was not  complicated. He was wise and interesting, but not
complicated. He  was just a straight-ahead growth-mindset guy who lived by
this rule: â€œY ou h ave to apply yo urself each day to becoming a little better .
By a pplying yourself to the task of becoming a little better eac h and every
day over a period of time, you will become a lot  better .â€
He didnâ€™ t ask fo r mistake-free games. He didnâ€™ t demand that his players
never lose. He asked for full preparation and full ef fort from th em. â€œDid I
win? Di d I lose? Those are the  wrong questions. The correct question is:
Did I make my best ef fort?â€ If s o, he says, â€œY ou may be outscored but you
will never lose. â€
He was not a s ofty . He did not tolerate coasting. If the playe rs were
coasting during  practice, he turned out the lights and left: â€œGentlemen,
practice is over .â€ They had lost their opportunity to become better that day .
EQUAL TREA TMENT
Like DeLay , W ooden gave equal time and attention to all of his players,
regardless of their initial skills. They , in turn, gave all, and blossomed. Here
is W ood en talking about two new players when they arrived at UCLA: â€œI
looked at each one to see what he had and then said to myself, â€˜Oh
gracious, if he c an make a real contribution, a playing  con tribution, to our
team then we m ust be pretty lou sy .â€™ However , what I couldnâ€™ t see was what
these men had in side.â€ Both gave just about everything they could possiblygive and both b ecame starters , one as the starting center on a national
championship team.
He r espected all players equally .  Y ou know how some playersâ€™ numbers
are retired after they move on, in homage to their greatness? No player â€™ s
number was retired while W ood en was coach, although he had some of the
greatest players of all time, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill W alton.
Later on , when their numbers were retired, he was against it. â€œO ther fellows
who pla yed on our team also wore those numbers. Some of those other
players gave me close to everything they had. . . . The jersey and the
number on it ne ver belong to just one single player , no matter h ow great or
how big a â€˜star â€™ that particular player is. It goes against the wh ole concept
of what a team is.â€
W ait a minute. He was in the business of winning games. Donâ€™ t you
have to go with your talented pl ayers and give less to the second stringers?
W ell, he  didnâ€™ t play  all play ers equa lly , but he gave to all players equally .
For exa mple, when he recruited another player the same y ear as Bill
W alton, he told him that he wou ld play very little in actual games because
of W alton. But h e promised him, â€œBy the time you graduate youâ€™ll get a pro
contract. Y ouâ€™ll be that good.â€ By his third year , the player was giving Bill
W alton all he could handle in practice. And when he turned pro, he was
named rookie of the year in his league.
PREP ARING PLA YERS FOR LIFE
W as W o oden a genius, a mag ician able to turn mediocre players into
champions? Actually , he admi ts that in terms of basketball tactics and
strategies, he was quite average.  What he was really good at wa s analyzing
and motivating his players. W ith  these skills he was able to help his players
fulfill their potential, not just in basketball, but in lifeâ€”something he found
even more rewarding than winning games.
Did W o odenâ€™ s methods work? Aside from the ten championship titles,
we have the testimony of his players, none of whom refer to firearms.
Bill W alton, Hall of Famer: â€œO f course, the real competition he was
preparing us for was life. . . . He taught us the values and characteristics that
could make us not only good players, but also good people.â€Denny Crum, successful coach : â€œI canâ€™ t imagine what my life would
have been had Coach W ooden n ot been my guiding light. As the years pass,
I a pprec iate him more and mor e and can only pray that I can have half as
much influence on the young people I coach as he has had on me.â€
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Hall of Famer: â€œThe wisdom of Coach W ooden
had a profound influence on me  as an athlete, but an even greater influence
on me as a human being. He is responsible, in part, for the person I am
today .â€
Listen to this story .
It was the moment of victory . UCLA had just won its first national
championship. B ut Coach W ooden was worried about Fred Slaughter , a
player who had started every game and had had a brilliant year up until this
final, championship game. The game had not been going well, and, as it got
worse and worse, W ooden felt a change had to made. So he pulled Fred.
The replacemen t player did a great job, and W ooden left him in until the
game was virtually won.
The vict ory was a peak moment. Not only had they just won their first
NCAA title by beating Duke, but they had ended the season with thirty
wins and zero losses. Y et W oodenâ€™ s concern for Fred dampened his
euphoria. As W ooden left the press conference and went to find Fred, he
opened the door to the dressing room. Fred was waiting for him. â€œCoach . . .
I want you to kn ow I understand. Y ou had to leave Doug in there because
he playe d so well, and I didnâ€™ t. I wanted to play in the worst w ay , but I do
understand, and if anyone says I was upset, itâ€™ s not true. Disapp ointed, yes,
but upset, no. And I was very happy for Doug.â€
â€œThere are coaches out there,â€ W ooden says, â€œwho have won
championships with the dictator approach, among them V ince Lombardi
and Bobby Knight. I had a dif ferent philosophy . . . . For m e, concern,
compassion, and consideration were always priorities of the highest order .â€
Read the story of Fred Slaughter again and you tell me whether , under
the s ame circumstances, Coach Knight would have rushed to console Daryl
Thomas. And would Knight hav e allowed Thomas to reach dow n to find his
pride, dignity , and generosity in his moment of disappointment?
Which Is the Enemy: Success or Failure?Pat Summitt was the coach of t he T ennessee womenâ€™ s basketba ll team, the
Lady V ols. She coached them t o eight national championships . She didnâ€™ t
come into the game with W oodenâ€™ s philosophical attitude, but was at first
more Knight-lik e in her stance. Every time the team lost, she co uldnâ€™ t let go
of it. She continued to live it, b eating it to death and torturing  herself and
the team with it. Then she graduated to a loveâ€“hate relationship with losing.
Emotionally , it still made her fe el sick. But she loved what it d id. It forces
everyone, players and coaches, to develop a more complete g ame. It was
success that had become the enemy .
W ooden calls it being â€œinfected â€ with success. Pat Riley , forme r coach
of t he championship Los Ang eles Lakers team, calls it the â€œdisease of
meâ€â€”thinking you  are the success, and chucking the discipline and the
work that got you there. Summ itt explained, â€œSuccess lulls you. It makes
the most ambitious of us com placent and sloppy .â€ As Summitt spoke,
T ennessee had won five NCAA Championships, but only once  when they
were fav ored to  win. â€œOn every  other occasion, we were upset . W eâ€™ve lost
as many as four or five titles that we were predicted to win.â€
After the 1996 championship, the team was complacent. Th e older
players were the national champions, and the new players exp ected to be
swept to victory merely by being at T ennessee. It was a dis aster . They
began to lose a nd lose badly . On December 15, they were crushed by
Stanford on their own home court. A few games later , they w ere crushed
again. Now they had five losses  and everyone had given up on them. The
North Carolina coach, meaning  to comfort Summitt, told her ,  â€œW ell, just
hang in  there â€™ til next year .â€ HBO had come to T ennessee  to film a
documentary , bu t now the producers were looking for another team. Even
her assistants were thinking they wouldnâ€™ t make it into the March
championship play-of fs.
So before the next game, Summitt met with the team for five hours.
That night, they played Old D ominion, the second-ranked t eam in the
country . For the first time that s eason, they gave all. But they lost again. It
was dev astating. They had invested, gone for it, and still lost. Some were
sobbing so hard, they couldnâ€™ t speak, or even breathe. â€œGet your heads up,â€
Summitt told them. â€œIf you give  ef fort like this all the time, if you fight like
this, Iâ€™m  telling you, I pr omise  you, weâ€™ll be there in March.â€ T wo months
later they were the national champions.Conclusion? Be ware of success. It can knock you into a fixed mindset:
â€œI won because I have talent. Therefore I will keep winning.â€ Success can
infect a team or it can infect an individual. Alex Rodriguez, the baseball
star , wa s not infected with success. â€œY ou never stay the same,â€ he says.
â€œY ou either go one way or the other .â€
F ALSE GROWTH MINDSET
I have seen many parents, tea chers, and coaches apply growth-mindset
concepts in the most spectacular ways, with wonderful results. Using
mindset principl es, many schools and sports teams have risen t o the topâ€”
theyâ€™ve been recognized for their outstanding culture of learning (and
teamwork) and for their exceptional achievements. Needless to say , this has
been extremely gratifying.
Then, a couple of years ago, my  colleague in Australia, Susan Mackie,
told me she wa s seeing an outbreakâ€”of â€œfalse growth minds et.â€ I didnâ€™ t
know what she was talking about. In fact, I was a bit irritated. Isnâ€™ t a growth
mindset a pretty simple and stra ightforward idea? Why would anyone have
a false growth mindset if they could have a real one?
But she had pla nted the seed, a nd as I went about my business, I soon
realized what she meant. Some parents, teachers, and coaches were indeed
misunderstanding the mindset i deas. All at once I became determined to
understand their misunderstandings and to figure out how to c orrect them.
So letâ€™ s take a closer look at 1) what a growth mindset is and is not, 2) how
to achieve it, and 3) how to pass it on to others.
What a Growth Mindset Is and Is Not
A growth mindset is about believing people can develop their abilities. Itâ€™ s
that simple. It ca n have many re percussions, but thatâ€™ s what it is at its core.
Nonetheless, many people project a dif ferent meaning onto it.
Misunderstanding #1. Many people take what they like about
themselves and  call it a â€œgrowth mindset.â€ If theyâ€™re open -minded or
flexible, they say they have a gr owth mindset. I often hear peop le calling it
an â€œ open mindset.â€ But thereâ€™ s a  dif ference between being flexible or open-
minded and being dedicated to growing talent. And if people drift awayfrom the actual meaning of a growth mindset, they drift away from its
benefits. They can bask in their own wonderful qualities but they may never
do the hard work of cultivating  their own abilities or the abilities of their
children or students.
Misunderstanding #2. Many people believe that a growth mindset is
only ab out ef fort, especially praising ef fort. I talked earlier about how
praising the process children en gage inâ€”their hard work, strategies, focus,
perseveranceâ€”can foster a growth mindset. In this way , children learn that
the p rocess they engage in brings about progress and learning, and that their
learning does not just magically flow from some innate ability .
The first important thing to rem ember here is that the pr ocess  includes
more tha n just ef fort. Certainly , we want children to appreciate the fruits of
hard wo rk. But we also want th em to understand the importance of trying
new stra tegies when the one th eyâ€™re using isnâ€™ t working. (W e donâ€™ t want
them to just try harder with the same inef fective strategy .) And we want
them to ask for  help or input from others when itâ€™ s needed. This is the
pr ocess  we wan t them to appreciate: hard work, trying new strategies,  and
seeking input from others.
Another pitfall is praising ef for t (or any part of the process) th atâ€™ s not
there. M ore than once, parents have said to me, â€œI praise my childâ€™ s ef fort
but itâ€™ s not wor king.â€ I immediately ask, â€œW as your child actually  trying
hard?â€ â€œW ell, not really ,â€ come s the sheepish reply . W e should never think
that praising a process that is not there will bring good results.
But a problem thatâ€™ s of even gre ater concern to me is the fact th at some
teachers and coaches are using ef fort praise as a consolation prize when
kids are not  learning. If a student has tried hard and made little or no
progress, we can of course appreciate their ef fort, but we should never be
content with ef fort that is not yielding further benefits. W e need to figure
out why  that ef fort is not ef fective and  guide kids toward other strategies
and resources that can help them resume learning.
Recently , someone asked me, â€œWhat keeps you up at night?â€ And I said,
â€œItâ€™ s the fear that the mindset concept will be used to make kids feel good
when theyâ€™re not learningâ€”just  like the failed self-esteem movement.â€ The
growth mindset is meant to help kids learn, not to paper over the fact that
they are not learning.Finally , when people realize Iâ€™ m the mindset person, they of ten say ,
â€œOh, yea ! Praise  the process no t the outcome, right?â€ W ell, not  quite. This
is such a common misconception. In all of our research on praise, we
indeed praise the process, but we tie it to the outcome,  that is, to childrenâ€™ s
learning, progress, or achievements. Children need to understand that
engaging in that process helped them learn.
Not long  ago, a mother told me how very frustrating it was that she was
not a llowed to p raise her daughter when the child did somethin g wonderful
â€”that she could only praise her  when she was struggling. No! No! No! Of
course  you can appreciate your childrenâ€™ s wonderful accomplishments, but
then tie those accomplishments to the process they engaged in.
And remember , we donâ€™ t have to always be praising. Inquiring about the
childâ€™ s process and just showing interest in it goes a very long way .
Misunderstanding #3. A growth mindset equals telling kids they can do
anything. Many â€™ s the time Iâ€™ve heard educators say , â€œIâ€™ve always had a
growth m indset. I always tell m y students, â€˜Y ou can do anyth ing!â€™ â€ Few
people b elieve i n childrenâ€™ s potential as much as I do, or year n to see all
children fulfill their enormous promise. But it doesnâ€™ t happen by simply
telling th em, â€œY ou can do anyth ing.â€ It happens by helping th em gain the
skills and find the resources  to make progress toward their goals.
Otherwise, itâ€™ s an empty reassurance. It puts the onus entirely on the student
and may make them feel like a failure if they donâ€™ t  reach their goals.
One fina l word about putting th e onus on the student. It broke my heart
to learn that some educators and coaches were blaming kids for having a
fixed mindsetâ€”scolding or criticizing them for not displaying growth-
mindset qualities. Notice that these adults were absolving themselves of the
responsibility , not only for teaching a growth mindset but a lso for the
childâ€™ s l earning: â€œI canâ€™ t teach t his child. He has a fixed mindset.â€ Letâ€™ s be
totally clear here. W e as educators must take seriously our responsibility to
create growth-mindset-friendly environmentsâ€”where kids feel safe from
judgment, where they understand that we believe in their poten tial to grow ,
and whe re they know that we are totally dedicated to collabo rating with
them on their le arning. W e are in the business of helping kids thrive, not
finding reasons why they canâ€™ t.How Do Y ou Get a (T rue) Growth Mindset?
Y ou don â€™ t get a growth mindset by proclamation. Y ou move toward it by
taking a journey .
As a growth min dset gained currency and became the â€œcorrectâ€  way to
think in some quarters, more an d more people claimed to have it. It sort of
makes s ense. Do nâ€™ t we all want  to see ourselves as enlightened people who
help children fulfill their potential? A noted educator told me that it had
become politica lly incorrect for educators to even talk about (and maybe
even think about) having a fixed mindset in any area. And a principal told
me that he was r ecently giving some mild suggestions to a teacher when she
looked at him indignantly and  said, â€œAre you implying I have a fixed
mindset?â€
Although for simplicity Iâ€™ve talked as though some people have  a
growth m indset and some people have  a fixed mindset, in truth weâ€™re all a
mixture of the t wo. Thereâ€™ s no point denying it. Sometimes weâ€™re in one
mindset and sometimes weâ€™re in the other . Our task then becomes to
understand wha t triggers our fixed mindset. What are the events or
situations that take us to a place where we feel our (or othe r peopleâ€™ s)
abilities are fixed? What are the events or situations that take us to a place
of judgment rather than to a place of development?
What happens when our fixe d-mindset â€œpersonaâ€ shows upâ€”the
character within  who warns us to avoid challenges and beats us up when we
fail at something ? How does that persona make us feel? What does it make
us think  and how does it make u s act? How do those thoughts, feelings, and
actions a f fect us and those aroun d us? And, most important, wha t can we do
over time to kee p that persona from interfering with our growth  and that of
our children? How can we persuade that fixed-mindset persona to get on
board with the goals that spring from our growth mindset?
Iâ€™ll addr ess these questions in the final chapter as we examine the
process of personal change. What I will emphasize here is that it is a long
journey , one that takes com mitment and persistence. Bu t once we
acknowledge tha t we all have recurrent fixed mindsets, we can  talk to one
another openly . W e can talk ab out our fixed-mindset personas, when they
show up, how t hey af fect us, and how weâ€™re learning to deal with them.And as we do, w e will realize t hat we have lots of fellow travelers on our
journey .
How Do Y ou Pass a Growth Mindset On?
Y ou would think that once adults adopted more of a growth mindset they
would automatically pass it on to kids. It would simply ooze out in their
words and deeds. Thatâ€™ s what we thought, but itâ€™ s not what weâ€™re finding.
Many adults are not passing on their growth mindsets. How is that possible?
First, letâ€™ s look at the findings. In a number of studies, we and
researchers looked at the mindsets of parents and their children. In each
case, ma ny parents held a growth mindset, but they were not necessarily
passing it on to  their children. In other studies, researchers looked at the
mindsets of teachers and their students. In each case, many teachers held a
growth mindset , but they were not necessarily passing it on to their
students. Something else was going on.
Of course, itâ€™ s possible that some of these parents or teachers had false
growth mindsets. But beyond that, weâ€™re finding something fascinating.
Adultsâ€™ mindsets are in their heads and are not directly visible to children.
Adultsâ€™ overt actions speak far louder , and this is what children are picking
up on. Unfortunately , these actions often donâ€™ t line up with the growth
mindsets in adultsâ€™ heads. So what are the actions that convey the dif ferent
mindsets?
First, no surprise, itâ€™ s the praise . Parentsâ€™ praise molds their ch ildrenâ€™ s
mindsets. Itâ€™ s interesting that this doesnâ€™ t necessarily line up with the
parentsâ€™ mindsets. Even paren ts who hold a growth mindset can find
themselves praising their childâ€™ s abilityâ€”and neglecting to focus on their
childâ€™ s l earning process. It can be hard to shake the idea that telling kids
theyâ€™re smart will build their confidence.
Second, itâ€™ s the way adults resp ond to childrenâ€™ s mistakes or failures.
When a child has a setback and the parent reacts with anxi ety or with
concern about the childâ€™ s ability , this fosters more of a fixed mi ndset in the
child. Th e paren t may try to gloss over the childâ€™ s failure but the  very act of
doing so  may convey that the failure is an issue. So, although parents may
hold a growth mindset, they may still display worry about t heir childâ€™ s
confidence or morale when the child stumbles.Itâ€™ s the parents who respond to  their childrenâ€™ s setbacks with interest
and treat them a s opportunities for learning who are transmittin g a growth
mindset to their children. These parents think setbacks are good things that
should be embraced, and that setbacks should be used as a platform for
learning. They address the setba ck head-on and talk to their children about
the next steps for learning.
In other words, every single day parents are teaching their children
whether mistakes, obstacles, an d setbacks are bad things or good things.
The parents who treat them as good things are more likely to pass on a
growth mindset to their children.
Third, passing on a growth mindset is about whether teachers are
teaching for understanding or ar e simply asking students to mem orize facts,
rules, and procedures. Research  is showing that when teachers  care about
deeper understanding and work with students to achieve it, then students are
more likely to believe that their abilities can be developed. One study found
that when math teachers taught for conceptual understanding, gave
feedback that deepened studentsâ€™ understanding, and then allowed students
to re vise their w ork (to experience and show their deeper und erstanding),
their students moved toward a growth mindset in math. These students
believed they could develop their basic mathematical ability .
On the other han d, when teachers thought of math as just a set of rules
and procedures to memorize, they could emphasize the importance of ef fort
or pe rsistence, but students coul d not feel their abilities growing  and did not
tend to move toward a growth mindset. By the way , many of th ese teachers
used the words â€œgrowth minds etâ€ in their classrooms, but th eir teaching
methodsâ€”their actionsâ€”did not foster that growth mindset in their
students.
Other studies paint a similar pic ture. In one study , high school students
talked a bout the ir math teachers. Some of them said that when they were
stuck, th eir teacher sat down with them and said things like this : â€œShow me
what youâ€™ve done, letâ€™ s try to understand how youâ€™re thinkin g, and then
letâ€™ s figu re out what you should try next.â€ The students who w ere treated
like thisâ€”as though understandi ng was of paramount importance and could
be achie ved with support from t he teacherâ€”were moving toward a growth
mindset in math.â– Y et in this era  of high-stakes testing, much teaching em phasizes
memorization o f facts, rules, and procedures to â€œinsureâ€ that students do
well on the all-important tests. As we have seen, this may pro mote more
fixed mindsets and perhaps, ironically , undermine studentsâ€™ performance on
these very tests. There is no thing like deep learning to insure good
outcomes.
Sadly , in  this atmosphere many students are coming to equate learning
with me morizing. I am hearing from many researchers and educators that
students across the economic spectrum are becoming increasingly unable to
grasp th e dif fere nce between memorizing facts, rules, and procedures and
truly un derstanding the concepts underlying the material. Asid e from the
bad news for growth mindsets, this also has disturbing implications for our
nation. Great contributions to  society are born of curiosity  and deep
understanding. I f students no l onger recognize and value deep learning,
where will the great contributions of the future come from?
W e were  initially surprised to find that many adults with growth mindsets
were no t passing  them on. However , the moral of this story is that parents,
teachers, and coaches pass on a growth mindset not by having a belief
sitting in  their heads but by embodying a growth mindset in thei r deeds: the
way they praise (conveying the  processes that lead to learning), the way
they treat setbacks (as opportun ities for learning), and the way they focus
on deepening understanding (as the goal of learning).
OUR LEGACY
As pare nts, teachers, and coaches, we are entrusted with peopleâ€™ s lives.
They are  our responsibility and  our legacy . W e now know that the growth
mindset has a k ey role to play in helping us  fulfill our mis sion and in
helping them  fulfill their potential.
Grow Y our Mindset
Every w ord and action from parent to child sends a messa ge.
T omorrow , liste n to what you say to your kids and tune in to theâ– 
â– 
â– 
â– 
â– 
â– messages youâ€™re sending. Are they messages that say: Y ou have
permanent traits and Iâ€™m judging them ? Or are they messages that
say Y ouâ€™r e a developing person and Iâ€™m inter ested in your
development ?
How do you use praise? Remember that praising childrenâ€™ s
intelligence or talent, tempting as it is, sends a fixed-mindset
message. It makes their confidence and motivation more fragile.
Instead, try to f ocus on the pr ocesses  th ey usedâ€”the ir strategies,
ef fort, or choices. Practice wor king the process praise into your
interactions with your children.
W atch and listen to yourself car efully when your child messes up.
Remember that constructive criticism is feedback that helps the
child un derstand how to fix som ething. Itâ€™ s not feedback that labels
or simpl y excuse s the child. At the end of each day , write down the
constructive criticism (and the process praise) youâ€™ve given your
kids.
Parents often set goals their chi ldren can work toward. Remember
that hav ing innate talent is n ot a goal. Expanding skills a nd
knowledge is. Pay careful attention to the goals you set for your
children.
If yo uâ€™re a teacher , remember th at lowering standards doesnâ€™ t raise
studentsâ€™ self-esteem. But neith er does raising standards without
giving students ways of reaching them. The growth mindset gives
you a way to set high standards and  have students re ach them. T ry
presenting topics in a growth framework and giving students
process feedback. I think youâ€™ll like what happens.
Do you think of your slower s tudents as kids who will never  be
able to learn w ell? Do they think of themselves as permanen tly
dumb? Instead, try to figure out what they donâ€™ t understand and
what learning strategies they donâ€™ t have. Remember that great
teachers believe in the growth of talent and intellect, and are
fascinated by the process of learning.
Are you  a fixed-mindset coach? Do you think first and foremost
about your record and your reputation? Are you intolerant of
mistakes? Do you try to motiva te your players through judgment?
That may be whatâ€™ s holding up your athletes.â– T ry on the growth mindset. Instead of asking for mistake-free
games, ask for f ull commitment and full ef fort. Instead of judg ing
the play ers, give them the resp ect and the coaching they need to
develop.
As parents, teachers, and coaches, our mission is developing
peopleâ€™ s potenti al. Letâ€™ s use all the lessons of the growth mindset
â€”and whatever else we canâ€”to do this.Chapter 8
CHANGING MINDSETS
T he growth mindset is based on the belief in change, and the most
gratifying part of my work is watching people change. Nothi ng is better
than see ing people find their way to things they value. This chap ter is about
kids and adults w ho found their way to using their abilities. And about how
all of us can do that.
THE NA TURE OF CHANGE
I wa s in the middle of first grad e when my family moved. Sud denly I was
in a new school . Everything was unfamiliarâ€”the teacher , the students, and
the work. The w ork was what te rrified me. The new class was way ahead of
my old one, or at least it seemed that way to me. They were writing letters I
hadnâ€™ t l earned to write yet. An d there was a way to do eve rything that
everyone seemed to know except me. So when the teacher said, â€œClass, put
your name on your paper in the right place,â€ I had no idea what she meant.
So I  cried. Each  day things came up that I didnâ€™ t know how to d o. Each
time, I felt lost and overwhelm ed. Why didnâ€™ t I just say to the teacher ,
â€œMrs. Kahn, I havenâ€™ t learned this yet. Could you show me how?â€
Another time when I was little, my parents gave me money to go to the
movies with an adult and a gro up of kids. As I rounded the corner to the
meeting place, I looked down the block and saw them all leaving. But
instead of running after them and yelling, â€œW ait for me!â€ I stood frozen,
clutching the coins in my hand and watching them recede into the distance.
Why didnâ€™ t I try to stop them o r catch up with them? Why did I accept
defeat b efore I had tried some s imple tactics? I know that in my dreams Ihad often performed magical or superhuman feats in the face of danger . I
even hav e a picture of myself in  my self-made Superman cape. Why , in real
life, couldnâ€™ t I do an ordinary thing like ask for help or call out for people to
wait?
In my work, I see lots of youn g children like thisâ€”bright, seemingly
resourceful child ren who are pa ralyzed by setbacks. In some of our studies,
they just have to take the simplest action to make things bett er . But they
donâ€™ t. T hese are  the young child ren with the fixed mindset. Whe n things go
wrong, they feel powerless and incapable.
Even no w , when something goes wrong or when something pr omising
seems to  be slipping away , I sti ll have a passing feeling of powerlessness.
Does that mean I havenâ€™ t changed?
No, it means that change isnâ€™ t li ke sur gery . Even when you cha nge, the
old belie fs aren â€™ t just removed like a worn-out hip or knee a nd replaced
with better ones. Instead, the new beliefs take their place alongside the old
ones, and as the y become stronger , they give you a dif ferent way to think,
feel, and act.
Beliefs Are the Key to Happiness (and to Misery)
In th e 19 60s, psy chiatrist Aaron  Beck was working with his clients when he
suddenly realized it was their beliefs  that were causing their problems. Just
before they felt a wave of anxie ty or depression, something quickly flashed
through their minds. It could b e: â€œDr . Beck thinks Iâ€™m incompetent.â€ Or
â€œThis therapy will never work. Iâ€™ll never feel better .â€ These kinds of beliefs
caused t heir neg ative feelings not only in the therapy session, but in their
lives, too.
They werenâ€™ t beliefs people were usually conscious of. Y et Beck found
he could teach people to pay attention and hear them. And then he
discovered he could teach them how to work with and change th ese beliefs.
This is how cognitive therapy was born, one of the most ef fective therapies
ever developed.
Whether theyâ€™re  aware of it or n ot, all people keep a running account of
whatâ€™ s h appening to them, what it means, and what they should do. In other
words, our minds are constantl y monitoring and interpreting. Thatâ€™ s just
how we stay on  track. But sometimes the interpretation process  goes awry .Some people put more extreme interpretations on things that happenâ€”and
then react with exaggerated fee lings of anxiety , depression, or anger . Or
superiority .
Mindsets Go Further
Mindsets frame the running account thatâ€™ s taking place in peopleâ€™ s heads.
They guide the whole interpreta tion process. The fixed mindset creates an
internal monologue that is focused on judging: â€œThis means I â€™m a loser .â€
â€œThis means Iâ€™m a better person than they are.â€ â€œThis means Iâ€™m a bad
husband.â€ â€œThis means my partner is selfish.â€
In several studies, we probed the way people with a fixed mindset dealt
with info rmation they were receiving. W e found that they put a very strong
evaluation on each and every piece of information. Something good led to a
very stro ng posi tive label and s omething bad led to a very strong negative
label.
People with a growth mindset are also constantly monitoring whatâ€™ s
going on, but th eir internal monologue is not about judging them selves and
others i n this way . Certainly theyâ€™re sensitive to positive and negative
information, bu t theyâ€™re attuned to its implications for learning and
constructive acti on: What can I learn from this? How can I imp rove? How
can I help my partner do this better?
Now , co gnitive therapy basically  teaches people to rein in their extreme
judgments and make them mor e reasonable. For example, suppose Alana
does poorly on a test and draws the conclusion, â€œIâ€™m stupid. â€ Cognitive
therapy would teach her to look more closely at the facts by asking: What is
the e vidence for and against yo ur conclusion? Alana may , after prodding,
come up  with a long list of ways in which she has been competent in the
past, and may then confess, â€œI guess Iâ€™m not as incompetent as I thought.â€
She may  also be encouraged to  think of reasons she did poorly on the
test other than stupidity , and  these may further temper h er negative
judgment. Alana is then taught how to do this for herself, so that when she
judges h erself ne gatively in the future, she can refute the judgment and feel
better .
In th is way , co gnitive therapy helps people make more realistic and
optimistic judgments. But it does not take them out of the fixed mindset andits w orld of judg ment.  It does not confront the basic assumptionâ€”the idea
that trait s are fixedâ€”that is caus ing them to constantly measure themselves.
In other words, it does not escort them out of the framework of judgment
and into the framework of growth.
This chapter is about changing the internal monologue from a judging
one to a growth-oriented one.
THE MINDSET LECTURES
Just learning about the growth mindset can cause a big shift in the way
people think about themselves and their lives.
So each  year in my under graduate course, I teach about these mindsets
â€”not only because they are part of the topic of the course but also because
I know what pressure these students are under . Every year , students describe
to me how these ideas have changed them in all areas of their lives.
Here is Maggie, the aspiring writer:
I rec ognized that when it come s to artistic or creative endeavo rs I
had internalized a fixed mindset. I believed that people were
inherently artistic or creative and that you could not imp rove
through ef fort. This directly af fected my life because I have always
wanted to be a writer , but have been afraid to pursue any writing
classes or to sha re my creative writing with others. This is dire ctly
related to my mindset because any negative criticism would mean
that I am not a w riter inherently . I was too scared to  expose  myself
to the possibility that I might not be a â€œnatural.â€
Now after listening to your lec tures, I have decided to registe r
for a creative writing class next term. And I feel that I have really
come to understand what was  preventing me from pursuing an
interest that has long been m y secret dream. I really feel this
information has empowered me!
Maggieâ€™ s intern al monologue used to say: Donâ€™ t do it. Do nâ€™ t take a
writing class. Donâ€™ t shar e your writing with others. Itâ€™ s not worth the risk.
Y our dr eam could be destr oyed. Pr otect it.Now it says: Go for it. Make it happen. Develop your skills. Pursue
your dr eam.
And hereâ€™ s Jason, the athlete:
As a student a thlete at Columbia I had exclusively the fixed
mindset. W inning was everyth ing and learning did not enter the
picture. However , after listening  to your lectures, I realized that this
is not a good mindset. Iâ€™ve been working on learning while I
compete, under the realization that if I can continually improve,
even in matches, I will become a much better athlete.
Jasonâ€™ s internal  monologue used to be: W in. W in. Y ou  have to win.
Pr ove yourself. Everything depends on it.
Now itâ€™ s: Observe. Learn. Impr ove. Become a better athlete.
And finally , hereâ€™ s T ony , the recovering genius:
In high school I was able to get top grades with minimal stud ying
and sleeping. I came to believe that it would always be so becau se I
was naturally gifted with a superior understanding and memory .
However , after about a year of sleep deprivation my understan ding
and memory began to not be so superior anymore. When my natural
talents, w hich I had come to dep end on almost entirely for my self-
esteem ( as oppo sed to my abilit y to focus, my determination or my
ability to  work hard), came into question, I went through a personal
crisis th at lasted until a few weeks ago when you discussed  the
dif ferent mindsets in class. Understanding that a lot of my problems
were the result of my preoccupation with proving myself to be
â€œsmartâ€ and avoiding failures has really helped me get out of the
self-destructive pattern I was living in.
T onyâ€™ s internal monologue went  from: Iâ€™m naturally gifted. I donâ€™ t need
to study . I donâ€™ t need to sleep. Iâ€™m superior .
T o: Uh-oh, Iâ€™m losing it. I canâ€™ t understand things, I canâ€™ t r emem ber
things. What am I now?
T o: Donâ€™ t wo rry so much about being smart. Donâ€™ t worry so much a bout
avoiding failur es. That becomes self-destructive. Letâ€™ s start to  study andsleep and get on with life.
Of c ourse, these people will h ave setbacks and disappointments, and
sticking to the growth mindset m ay not always be easy . But just knowing it
gave them another way to be. Instead of being held captive by some
intimidating fan tasy about the Great W riter , the Great Athlete, or the Great
Genius, the growth mindset gave them courage to embrace their own goals
and dreams. And more important, it gave them a way to work toward
making them real.
A MINDSET WORKSHOP
Adolescence, as weâ€™ve seen, is a time when hordes of kids turn of f to
school. Y ou can almost hear the stampede as they try to get as far from
learning as possible. This is a t ime when students are facing some of the
biggest challeng es of their youn g lives, and a time when they are heavily
evaluating themselves, often wi th a fixed mindset. It is precisely the kids
with the  fixed mindset who panic and run for cover , showing plummeting
motivation and grades.
Over th e past few years, we â€™ve developed a workshop for these
students. It teaches them the growth mindset and how to apply it to their
schoolwork. Here is part of what theyâ€™re told:
Many pe ople thi nk of the brain as a mystery . They donâ€™ t know m uch
about intelligenc e and how it works. When they do think about w hat
intelligence is, many people believe that a person is born either
smart, a verage, or dumbâ€”and  stays that way for life. But new
research shows that the brain is more like a muscleâ€”it changes  and
gets stro nger wh en you use it. And scientists have been able to s how
just how the brain grows and gets stronger when you learn.
W e then  describe how the brai n forms new connections and â€œgrowsâ€
when people practice and learn new things.
When you learn new things, t hese tiny connections in the b rain
actually multiply  and get stronger . The more that you challenge your
mind to learn, the more your brain cells grow . Then, things that youonce fou nd very  hard or even impossibleâ€”like speaking a foreign
language or doing algebraâ€”see m to become easy . The result is a
stronger , smarter brain.
W e go on to point out that nobo dy laughs at babies and says how dumb
they are because they canâ€™ t talk. They just havenâ€™ t learned yet. W e show
students pictures of how the de nsity of brain connections changes during
the f irst years of life as babies pay attention, study their world , and learn
how to do things.
Over a series o f sessions, through activities and discussions, students
are taught study skills and show n how to apply the lessons of the growth
mindset to their studying and their schoolwork.
Students love learning about the brain, and the discussions are very
lively . B ut even more rewarding are the comments students make about
themselves. Letâ€™ s revisit Jimmy , the hard-core turned-of f student from
chapter 3 . In our very firs t workshop, we were amazed to hear him say w ith
tears in his eyes: â€œY ou mean I donâ€™ t have to be dumb?â€
Y ou may  think these students a re turned of f, but I saw that the y never
stop caring. Nobody gets used t o feeling dumb. Our workshop told Jimmy ,
â€œY ouâ€™re in char ge of your mind. Y ou can help it grow by using it in the right
way .â€ And as th e workshop progressed, here is what Jimmyâ€™ s teacher said
about him:
Jimmy , who never puts in any extra ef fort and often doesnâ€™ t turn in
homework on time, actually st ayed up late working for hour s to
finish an assignment early so I could review it and give hi m a
chance t o revise it. He earned a B+ on the assignment (he had been
getting Câ€™ s and lower).
Incidentally , tea chers werenâ€™ t just trying to be nice to us by telling us
what we wanted to hear . The teachers didnâ€™ t know  w ho was in our  growth-
mindset worksh op. This was because we had another workshop too. This
workshop met just as many times, and taught them even more study skills.
And stu dents got just as much  personal attention from supportive tutors.
But they didnâ€™ t learn the growth mindset and how to apply it.T eachers didnâ€™ t know which of their students went to which  of the
workshops, but they still singled out Jimmy and many  of the s tudents in the
growth-mindset workshop to te ll us that theyâ€™d seen real changes in their
motivation to learn and improve.
Lately I have no ticed that some students have a greater appreciation
for improvemen t. . . . R. was performing below standards. . . . He
has learned to appreciate the improvement from his grades of 52, 46,
and 49 to his grades of 67 and 71. . . . He valued his growth in
learning Mathematics.
M. was far belo w grade level. During the past several weeks, she
has volu ntarily asked for extra help from me during her lunch pe riod
in order to improve her test-taking performance. Her grades
drastically improved from failing to an 84 on the most recent exam.
Positive changes in motivation and behavior are noticeable in K. and
J. They have begun to work hard on a consistent basis.
Several students have voluntarily participated in peer tutoring
sessions during their lunch periods or after school. Students such as
N. and S. were passing when they requested the extra help and were
motivated by the prospect of sheer improvement.
W e were eager to see whether the workshop af fected studentsâ€™ grades,
so, with  their permission, we lo oked at studentsâ€™ final marks at the end of
the semester . W e looked espe cially at their math grades, since these
reflected real learning of challenging new concepts.
Before the workshops, studentsâ€™  math grades had been suf fering badly .
But afterward, lo and behold, students whoâ€™d been in the growth-mindset
workshop show ed a jump in their grades. They were now clearly doing
better than the students whoâ€™d been in the other workshop.
The growth-mindset workshopâ€”just eight sessions longâ€”had a real
impact. This one adjustment of studentsâ€™ beliefs seemed to unleash their
brain po wer and inspire them to  work and achieve. Of course, they were in
a sc hool where the teachers were responsive to their outpouring ofmotivation, and were willing to  put in the extra work to help them learn.
Even so, these findings show the power of changing mindsets.
The students in the other workshop did not improve. Despite their eight
sessions of training in study skills and other good things, they showed no
gains. Because they were not ta ught to think dif ferently about their minds,
they were not motivated to put the skills into practice.
The min dset workshop put students in char ge of their brains. Freed from
the vise of the fixed mindset, Jimmy and others like him could now use
their minds more freely and fully .
BRAINOLOGY
The prob lem with the workshop was that it required a big staf f to deliver it.
This wouldnâ€™ t be feasible on a lar ge scale. Plus, the teach ers werenâ€™ t
directly involve d. They could be a big factor in helping to sustain the
studentsâ€™ gains. So we decided to put our workshop on interactive computer
modules and have teachers guide their classes through the modules.
W ith the advice of education al experts, media experts, and brain
experts, we developed the â€œBrainologyâ€â„¢ program. It presents animated
figures, Chris and Dahliaâ€”sev enth graders who are cool but  are having
problems with their schoolwork. Dahlia is having trouble with Spanish, and
Chris w ith math. They visit the lab of Dr . Cerebrus, a slightly  mad brain
scientist, who teaches them all about the brain and the care and feeding of
it. He teaches them what to do  for maximum performance from the brain
(like sle eping enough, eating the right things, and using good study
strategies) and he teaches them how the brain grows as they learn. The
program, all along, shows students how Chris and Dahlia apply these
lessons to their schoolwork. The interactive portions allow students to do
brain experimen ts, see videos of  real students with their problem s and study
strategies, recom mend study plans for Chris and Dahlia, and keep a journal
of their own problems and study plans.
Here are some o f the seventh g raders writing about how this program
changed them:
After Br ainology , I now have a new look at things. Now , my atti tude
towards the subjects I have trou ble in [is] I try harder to study andmaster t he skill s. . . . I have been using my time more wisely ,
studying every day and reviewin g the notes that I took on that day . I
am reall y glad that I joined this program because it increased my
intelligence about the brain.
I did  change my  mind about ho w the brain works and i do things
dif ferently . i will try harder beca use i know that the more you try  the
more your brain works.
ALL i can say is that Brainology changed my grades. Bon V oyage!
The Brainology  program kind o f made me change the way i w ork
and stud y and practice for school work now that i know how  my
brain works and what happens when i learn.
Thank y ou for making us study more and helping us build up  our
brain! I actually picture my neu rons growing bigger as they m ake
more connections.
T eachers told us how formerly t urned-of f students were now talking the
Brainology talk. For example, they were taught that when they studied well
and learned something, they transferred it from temporary storage (working
memory) to more permanent storage (long-term memory). Now  they were
saying to each other: â€œIâ€™ll have to put that into my long-term memory .â€
â€œSorry , t hat stuf f  is not in my long-term memory .â€ â€œI guess I was only using
my working memory .â€
T eachers said that students were also of fering to practice, study , take
notes, or  pay attention more to m ake sure that neural connections would be
made. As one student said:
â€œY es the  [B]rainology program helped a lot. . . . Every time I thought
about no t doing work I rememb ered that my neurons could grow  if I did do
the work.â€
The teachers also changed. Not only did they say great things about how
their students benefited, they al so said great things about the insights they
themselves had gained. In particular , they said Brainology was essential for
understanding:â€œThat all  st udents  can learn, even the ones who struggle with math and
with self-control.â€
â€œThat I have to be more patien t because learning takes a great  deal of
time and practice.â€
â€œHow the brain works. . . . Each learner learns dif ferently . Brainology
assisted me in teaching for various learning styles.â€
Our workshop went to children in twenty schools. Some children
admitted to being skeptical at first: â€œi used to think it was just free time and
a go od c artoon but i started listening to it and i started doing what they told
me to do.â€ In the end, almost all children reported meaningful benefits.
MORE ABOUT CHANGE
Is chang e easy or hard? So far  it sounds easy . Simply learning about the
growth m indset can sometimes mobilize people for meeting challenges and
persevering.
The othe r day one of my former grad students told me a story . But first
some ba ckground. In my field, when you submit a research paper for
publication, that  paper often represents years of work. Some m onths later
you receive your reviews: ten or so pages of criticismâ€”single-spaced. If the
editor st ill think s the paper has potential, you will be invited to revise it and
resubmit it pr ovided you can addr ess every criticism.
My stud ent reminded me of the  time she had sent her thesis res earch to
the top journal in our field. When the reviews came back, she was
devastated. She had been judgedâ€”the work was flawed and, by extension,
so was she. T ime passed, but she couldnâ€™ t bring herself to go near the
reviews again or work on the paper .
Then I told her to change her m indset. â€œLook,â€ I said, â€œitâ€™ s not about
you. Tha tâ€™ s their  job. Their job is to find every possible flaw . Y o ur job is to
learn fro m the critique and make your paper even better .â€ W ithin hours she
was revi sing her  paper , which w as warmly accepted. She tells m e: â€œI never
felt judg ed again. Never . Every time I get that critique, I tell myself, â€˜Oh,
thatâ€™ s their job,â€™ and I get to work immediately on my  job.â€
But change is also hard.
When people hold on to a fixed mindset, itâ€™ s often for a reason. At some
point in their liv es it served a good purpose for them. It told the m who theywere or who th ey wanted to be  (a smart, talented child) and it told them
how to be that (perform well). In this way , it provided a formula for self-
esteem and a path to love and respect from others.
The idea that th ey are worthy a nd will be loved is crucial for children,
andâ€”if a child is unsure about  being valued or lovedâ€”the fixed mindset
appears to of fer a simple, straightforward route to this.
Psychologists K aren Horney and Carl Rogers, working in the mid-
1900s, both proposed theories of childrenâ€™ s emotional development. T hey
believed that when young children feel insecure about being accepted by
their par ents, th ey experience great anxiety . They feel lost and  alone in a
complicated world. Since theyâ€™ re only a few years old, they canâ€™ t simply
reject their parents and say , â€œI think Iâ€™ll go it alone.â€ They have to find a
way to feel safe and to win their parents over .
Both Horney and Rogers proposed that children do this by creating or
imagining other  â€œselves,â€ ones that their parents might like b etter . These
new selv es are what they think the parents are looking for an d what may
win them the parentsâ€™ acceptance.
Often, t hese steps are good adjustments to the family situatio n at the
time, bringing the child some security and hope.
The problem is that this new selfâ€”this all-competent, strong, good self
that they  now try to beâ€”is likely to be a fixed-mindset self. Ov er time, the
fixed traits may come to be the personâ€™ s sense of who the y are, and
validating these traits may come to be the main source of their self-esteem.
Mindset change asks people to g ive this up. As you can imagine, itâ€™ s not
easy to just let go of something that has felt like your â€œselfâ€ for many years
and that has given you your route to self-esteem. And itâ€™ s especially not
easy to replace i t with a mindset  that tells you to embrace all the things that
have felt threatening: challenge, struggle, criticism, setbacks.
When I was ex changing my fixed mindset for a growth one, I was
acutely aware of how unsettled I felt. For example, Iâ€™ve told you how as a
fixed mindsetter , I kept track ea ch day of all my successes. At the end of a
good da y , I could look at the results (the high numbers on my intelligence
â€œcounter ,â€ my personality â€œcounter ,â€ and so on) and feel good about myself.
But as I adopted a growth mindset and stopped keeping track, so me nights I
would s till chec k my mental counters and find them at zero. It made me
insecure not to be able to tote up my victories.Even worse, since I was taking  more risks, I might look back over the
day and see all the mistakes and setbacks. And feel miserable.
Whatâ€™ s more, itâ€™ s not as though the fixed mindset wants to leave
gracefully . If the fixed mind set has been controlling your internal
monologue, it can say some pretty strong things to you when i t sees those
counters at zero: â€œY ouâ€™re nothing. â€ It can make yo u want to rush  right out
and rack  up some high numbers. The fixed mindset once of fered you refuge
from that very feeling, and it of fers it to you again.
Donâ€™ t take it.
Then thereâ€™ s the concern that y ou wonâ€™ t be yourself anymore. It may
feel as though the fixed mindset gave you your ambition, your edge, your
individuality . M aybe you fear y ouâ€™ll become a bland cog in the wheel just
like everyone else. Ordinary .
But opening yourself up to growth makes you mor e  yourself, not less.
The growth-oriented scientists, artists, athletes, and CEOs weâ€™v e looked at
were far from humanoids going through the motions. They we re people in
the full flower of their individuality and potency .
OPENING YOURSELF UP T O GROWTH
The rest of the  book is pretty much about you. First are so me mindset
exercises in which I ask you to venture with me into a series of dilemmas.
In each case, youâ€™ll first see th e fixed-mindset reactions, and then work
through to a growth-mindset solution.
The First Dilemma.  Im agine youâ€™ve applied to g raduate school. Y ou
applied to just o ne place because it was the school you had yo ur heart set
on. And  you were confident youâ€™d be accepted since many people
considered your  work in your field to be original and exciting. But you
were rejected.
The Fixed-Mindset Reaction.  At first you tell yourself that it was
extremely competitive, so it doesnâ€™ t really reflect on you. They probably
had more first-rate applicants than they could accept. Then the voice in your
head starts in. It tells you that youâ€™re fooling yourself, rationalizing. It tells
you tha t the admissions committee found your work mediocre. After awhile, you tell y ourself itâ€™ s probably true. The work is probably ordinary ,
pedestrian, and theyâ€™d seen that . They were experts. The verdi ct is in and
youâ€™re not worthy .
W ith som e ef fort you talk yourself back into your first, reasonable, and
more flattering conclusion, and you feel better . In the fixed min dset (and in
most cognitive therapies), thatâ€™ s the end of it. Y ouâ€™ve regained your self-
esteem, so the job is finished. But in the growth mindset, thatâ€™ s just the first
step. All  youâ€™ve done is talk to yourself. Now comes the learning and self-
improvement part.
The Growth-Mindset Step.  Think about your goal and think about what you
could do  to stay on track toward  achieving it. What steps could  you take to
help yourself succeed? What information could you gather?
W ell, m aybe yo u could apply to  more schools next time. Or maybe, in
the mean time, y ou could gather more information about what makes a good
application: Wh at are they looking for? What experiences do they value?
Y ou could seek out those experiences before the next application.
Since th is is a true story , I know what step the rejected applicant took.
She was  given some strong gro wth-mindset advice and, a few days later ,
she calle d the school. When she located the relevant person and told him
the situation, she said, â€œI donâ€™ t w ant to dispute your decision. I just want to
know , if I decide to apply again in the future, how I can improve my
application. I would be very grateful if you could give me som e feedback
along those lines.â€
Nobody scof fs at an honest plea for helpful feedback. Several days later ,
he c alled her back and of fered her admission. It had indeed been a close call
and, after reconsidering her app lication, the department decided they could
take one more person that year . Plus, they liked her initiative.
She had  reached  out for informa tion that would allow her to learn from
experience and improve in the  future. It turned out in this case that she
didnâ€™ t have to improve her application. She got to plunge right into learning
in her new graduate program.
Plans That Y ouâ€™ ll Carry Out and Ones That Y ou W onâ€™ tThe key  part of our applicantâ€™ s  reaction was her call to the sc hool to get
more informatio n. It wasnâ€™ t easy . Every day people plan to do dif ficult
things, b ut they donâ€™ t do them. They think, â€œIâ€™ll do it tomorrow ,â€ and they
swear to  themselves that theyâ€™ll follow through the next day . Research by
Peter Gollwitzer and his colleagues shows that vowing, even intense
vowing, is often useless. The next day comes and the next day goes.
What works is making a vivid , concrete plan: â€œT omorrow during my
break, Iâ€™ll get a cup of tea, close the door to my of fice, and call the graduate
school.â€ Or , in a nother case: â€œOn W ednesday morning, right af ter I get up
and brush my teeth, Iâ€™ll sit at my desk and start writing my report.â€ Or:
â€œT onight, right after the dinner dishes are done, Iâ€™ll sit down with my wife
in th e living roo m and have that discussion. Iâ€™ll say to her , â€˜Dea r , Iâ€™d like to
talk about something that I think will make us happier .â€™ â€
Think o f something you need to do, something you want to lea rn, or a
problem you have to confront. W hat is it? Now make a concrete plan. When
will you  follow through on your  plan? Wher e  will you do it? How  will you
do it? Think about it in vivid detail.
These concrete plansâ€”plans you can visualizeâ€”about when, wher e,
and how  you  are going to do something lead to really high levels of follow-
through, which, of course, ups the chances of success.
So the idea is not only to ma ke a growth-mindset plan, but also to
visualize, in a concrete way , how youâ€™re going to carry it out.
Feeling Bad, But Doing Good
Letâ€™ s go back a few paragraphs to when you were rejected by t he graduate
school. Suppose  your attempt t o make yourself feel better had  failed. Y ou
could still have taken the gr owth-mindset step.  Y ou  can feel miserable and
still reach out for information that will help you improve.
Sometimes after  I have a setback, I go through the process of talking to
myself a bout what it means an d how I plan to deal with it. Everything
seems fineâ€”until I sleep on it.  In my sleep, I have dream aft er dream of
loss, fai lure, or rejection, depending on what happened. Once when Iâ€™d
experienced a loss, I went to sle ep and had the following dreams: My hair
fell out, my teeth fell out, I had a baby and it died, and so on. A nother time
when I felt rejected, my dreams generated countless rejection experiencesâ€”real and  imagine d. In each insta nce, the incident triggered a the me, and my
too-active imagination gathered up all the variations on the theme to place
before me. When I woke up, I felt as though Iâ€™d been through the wars.
It would be nice if this didnâ€™ t happen, but itâ€™ s irr elevant.  It  might be
easier to mobilize for action if I  felt better , but it doesnâ€™ t matter . The plan is
the plan. Remember the depressed students with the growth mindset? The
worse they felt, the more they d id the constructive thing. The le ss they felt
like it, the more they made themselves do it.
The critical thing is to make a concrete, growth-oriented plan , and to
stick to it.
The Number One Draft Choice
The last dilemma seemed hard, b ut, basically , it was solved by a phone call.
Now im agine youâ€™re a promising quarterback. In fact, youâ€™re th e winner of
the H eisman trophy , college foo tballâ€™ s highest award. Y ouâ€™re the top draft
pick of the Phila delphia Eagles, the team youâ€™ve always dreame d of playing
for . So whatâ€™ s the dilemma?
The Second Dilemma.  The pressure is overwhelmin g. Y ou yearn for
playing time in the games, but every time they put you in a game to try you
out, you turn anxious and lose your focus. Y ou were always cool under
pressure, but this is the pros. No w all you see are giant guys com ing toward
youâ€”twelve hundred pounds o f giant guys who want to take you apart.
Giant guys who move faster than you ever thought possibl e. Y ou feel
cornered . . . helpless.
The Fixed-Mindset Reaction.  Y ou torture yourself with the idea that a
quarterback is a leader and youâ€™re no leader . How could you ever inspire
the confidence of your teammates when you canâ€™ t get your act together to
throw a good pa ss or scramble for a few yards? T o make things worse, the
sportscasters keep asking, What happened to the boy wonder?
T o m inimize the humiliation you  begin to keep to yourself and, to avoid
the sportscasters, you disappear into the locker room right after the game.
Whoa. Is this a recipe for success? What steps could you take to make
things better? Think about the resources at your disposal and how you coulduse them. But first, get your mindset turned around.
The Growth-Mindset Step.  In the growth m indset, you tell yourself that the
switch to the pro fessionals is a h uge step, one that takes a lot of adjustment
and a lot of learn ing. There are many things you couldnâ€™ t possib ly know yet
and that youâ€™d better start finding out about.
Y ou try to spend  more time with the veteran quarterbacks, aski ng them
questions and watching tapes with them. Instead of hiding your insecurities,
you talk about h ow dif ferent it i s from college. They , in turn, tell you thatâ€™ s
exactly how they felt. In fact, they share their humiliating stories with you.
Y ou ask  them what they did to overcome the initial dif ficulties and they
teach you their mental and physical techniques. As you begin to feel more
integrated into the team, you realize youâ€™re part of an or ganization that
wants to  help you grow , not ju dge and belittle you. Rather tha n worrying
that they  overpa id for your tale nt, you begin to give them their moneyâ€™ s
worth of incredibly hard work and team spirit.
PEOPLE WHO DONâ€™T W ANT T O CHANGE
Entitlement: The W orld Owes Y ou
Many people with the fixed mindset think the world  needs to change, not
them. They feel entitled to some thing betterâ€”a better job, house, or spouse.
The world should recognize their special qualities and treat them
accordingly . Let â€™ s move to the next dilemma and imagine you rself in this
situation.
The Next Dilemma.  â€œ Here I am,â€ y ou think, â€œin t his low-level job. Itâ€™ s
demeaning. W it h my talent I shouldnâ€™ t have to work like this. I should be
up there with th e big boys, enjoying the good life.â€ Y our boss thinks you
have a bad attitude. When she needs someone to take on more
responsibilities, she doesnâ€™ t turn to you. When itâ€™ s time t o give out
promotions, she doesnâ€™ t include you.
The Fixed-Mindset Reaction.  â€œSh eâ€™ s threatened by me,â€ you  say bitterly .
Y our fixed mindset is telling yo u that, because of who you are, you shouldautomatically be  thrust into the upper levels of the business. In your mind,
people s hould s ee your talents and reward you. When they donâ€™ t, itâ€™ s not
fair . Why should you  change? Y ou just want your due.
But putt ing your self in a growth  mindset, what are some new ways you
could th ink and  some steps you  could take? For example, wh at are some
new ways you c ould think about ef fort? About learning? And  how could
you act on this new thinking in your work?
W ell, you could consider work ing harder and being more he lpful to
people at work. Y ou could use your time to learn more about t he business
youâ€™re i n instea d of bellyaching about your low status. Letâ€™ s see how this
might look.
The Growth-Mindset Step.  B ut first, letâ€™ s be clear . For a long time, itâ€™ s
frightening to think of giving up the idea of being superior . An ordinary ,
run-of-the-mill human being isnâ€™ t what you want to be. How could you feel
good ab out you rself if youâ€™re n o more valuable than the peop le you look
down on?
Y ou beg in to consider the idea that some people stand out bec ause of
their commitment and ef fort. Little by little you try putting more ef fort into
things and seeing if you get more of the rewards you wanted. Y ou do.
Although you can slowly accept  the idea that ef fort might be necessary ,
you still canâ€™ t accept that itâ€™ s no guarantee. Itâ€™ s enough of an indignity to
have to work at things, but to w ork and still  not hav e them turn out the way
you wantâ€”now , thatâ€™ s really not fair . That means you could work hard and
somebody else could still get the promotion. Outrageous.
Itâ€™ s a long time before you begin to enjoy  p utting  in ef fort and a long
time bef ore you begin to think in terms of learning. Instead of seeing your
time at the bottom of the corpor ate ladder as an insult, you slowly see that
you can learn a lot at the bottom  that could help you greatly on your rise to
the t op. Learning the nuts and bolts of the company could later give you a
big a dvantage. All of our top gr owth-mindset CEOs knew their  companies
from top to bottom, inside out, and upside down.
Instead of seeing your discussio ns with your colleagues as tim e spent
getting w hat you  want, you begi n to grasp the idea of building r elationships
or even  helping your colleagues develop in ways they valu e. This canbecome a new s ource of satisfaction. Y ou might say you were f ollowing in
the footsteps of Bill Murray and his Groundhog Day experience.
As you become  a more growth -minded person, youâ€™re amazed at how
people start to help you, support you. They no longer seem like adversaries
out to deny you what you deserve. Theyâ€™re more and more often
collaborators toward a common goal. Itâ€™ s interesting, you started out
wanting to change other peopleâ€™ s behaviorâ€”and you did.
In the end, man y people with the fixed mindset understand that their
cloak of specialness was really a suit of armor they built to feel safe, strong,
and worthy . While it may have protected them early on, later it constricted
their growth, sent them into se lf-defeating battles, and cut them of f from
satisfying, mutual relationships.
Denial: My Life Is Perfect
People i n a fixed mindset often r un away from their problems. If  their life is
flawed, then theyâ€™r e  flawed. Itâ€™ s easier to make believe everythingâ€™ s all
right. T ry this dilemma.
The Dilemma.  Y ou seem to have everything. Y ou have a fulfilling career , a
loving marriage , wonderful children, and devoted friends. But one of those
things is nâ€™ t true.  Unbeknownst to you, your marriage is ending.  Itâ€™ s not that
there havenâ€™ t been signs, but y ou chose to misinterpret them. Y ou were
fulfilling your idea of the â€œmanâ€™ s roleâ€ or the â€œwomanâ€™ s role,â€ and couldnâ€™ t
hear your partner â€™ s desire for m ore communication and more  sharing of
your lives. By t he time you w ake up and take notice, itâ€™ s too late. Y our
spouse has disengaged emotionally from the relationship.
The Fixed-Mindset Reaction.  Y ouâ€™ve always felt sorry for div orced people,
abandoned peop le. And now y ouâ€™re one of them. Y ou lose all sense of
worth. Y our partner , who knew you intimately , doesnâ€™ t want you anymore.
For mon ths, you donâ€™ t feel like going on, convinced that even your
children would be better of f without you. It takes you a while to get to the
point wh ere you feel at all useful or competent. Or hopeful. Now  comes the
hard par t becaus e, even though you now feel a little better abo ut yourself,
youâ€™re s till in the fixed mindset. Y ouâ€™re embarking on a lifetime of judging.W ith everything  good that happens, your internal voice says, Maybe Iâ€™m
okay after all.  But with everything bad that happens, the voice says, My
spouse was right.  E very new pers on you meet is judged tooâ€”as a potential
betrayer .
How co uld you rethink your marriage, yourself, and your life  from a
growth-mindset perspective? Why were you afraid to listen to your spouse?
What could you have done? What should you do now?
The Growth-Mindset Step.  First, itâ€™ s not th at the marriage, which you used
to think of as in herently good, suddenly turned out to have been all bad or
always bad. It was an evolving thing that had stopped developing for lack
of nouri shment. Y ou need to th ink about how both you and your spouse
contributed to this, and especially about why you werenâ€™ t able to hear the
request for greater closeness and sharing.
As you probe, you realize that, in your fixed mindset, you s aw your
partner â€™ s reques t as a criticism of you that you didnâ€™ t want to hear . Y ou also
realize that at s ome level, you were afraid you werenâ€™ t capable of the
intimacy your partner was requesting. So instead of exploring these issues
with your spouse, you turned a deaf ear , hoping they would go away .
When a relationship goes sour , these are the issues we all need to
explore in depth, not to judge ourselves for what went wrong, but to
overcome our fears and learn the communication skills weâ€™ll need to build
and mai ntain better relationships  in the future. Ultimately , a growth mindset
allows people to carry forth not judgments and bitternes s, but new
understanding and new skills.
Is so meone in y our life trying t o tell you something youâ€™re ref using to
hear? Step into the growth mindset and listen again.
CHANGING YOUR CHILDâ€™S MINDSET
Many of our children, our most precious resource, are stuck in a fixed
mindset. Y ou can give them a personal Brainology workshop. L etâ€™ s look at
some ways to do this.
The Precocious Fixed MindsetterMost ki ds who adopt a fixed  mindset donâ€™ t become truly passionate
believers until later in childhood. But some kids take to it much earlier .
The Dilemma.  Imagine your young son come s home from school one day
and says to you,  â€œSome kids are  smart and some kids are dumb. They have
a wo rse brain.â€ Y ouâ€™re appalled.  â€œWho told you that?â€ you ask h im, gearing
up to complain to the school. â€œI  figured it out myself,â€ he says proudly . He
saw that  some children could r ead and write their letters and add a lot of
numbers, and others couldnâ€™ t. H e drew his conclusion. And he  held fast to
it.
Y our son is precocious in all aspects of the fixed mindset, and soon the
mindset is in fu ll flower . He d evelops a distaste for ef fortâ€”he wants his
smart brain to churn things out quickly for him. And it often does.
When he takes to chess very quickly , your spouse, thinking to  inspire
him, rents the movie Sear ching for Bobby Fischer ,  a  film about a  young
chess ch ampion. What your son learns from the film is that you could lose
and not be a champion anymore. So he retires. â€œIâ€™m a chess champion,â€ he
announces to one and all. A champion who wonâ€™ t play .
Because he now understands w hat losing means, he takes furth er steps
to avoid it. He starts cheating at Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, and
other games.
He talks  often about all the thin gs he can do and other children canâ€™ t.
When y ou and your spouse tell him that other children arenâ€™ t dumb, they
just havenâ€™ t practiced as much as he has, he refuses to believe it. He
watches things carefully at school and then comes home and reports, â€œEven
when the teacher shows us som ething new , I can do it better t han them. I
donâ€™ t have to practice.â€
This boy  is invested in his brain â€”not in making it grow but in singing
its p raises. Y ouâ€™ve already told him that itâ€™ s about practice and l earning, not
smart and dumb, but he doesnâ€™ t buy it. What else can you do? What are
other ways you can get the message across?
The Growth-Mindset Step.  Y ou decide that, rather than trying to talk him
out o f th e fixed mindset, you have to live the growth mindset. A t the dinner
table each evening, you and you r partner structure the discussion around the
growth mindset, asking each child (and each other): â€œWhat di d you learntoday?â€ â€œWhat mistake did you make that taught you something?â€ â€œWhat
did you try hard at today?â€ Y ou go around the table with each question,
excitedly discus sing your own a nd one another â€™ s ef fort, strategies, setbacks,
and learning.
Y ou talk about skills you have  today that you didnâ€™ t have yesterday
because of the p ractice you put in. Y ou dramatize mistakes you made that
held the  key to the solution, telling it like a mystery story . Y ou describe
with reli sh things youâ€™re struggling with and making progress o n. Soon the
children canâ€™ t wait each night to tell their stories. â€œOh my goodness,â€ you
say with wonder , â€œyou certainly did get smarter today!â€
When yo ur fixed-mindset son tells stories about doing things better than
other ch ildren, everyone says, â€œY eah, but what did you learn? â€ When he
talks about how easy everything is for him in school, you all say , â€œOh, thatâ€™ s
too bad.  Y ouâ€™re not learning. C an you find something harder to do so you
could learn more?â€ When he  boasts about being a champ, you say ,
â€œChamps are the people who w ork the hardest. Y ou can become  a champ.
T omorrow tell me something youâ€™ve done to become a champ .â€ Poor kid,
itâ€™ s a conspiracy . In the long run, he doesnâ€™ t stand a chance.
When he  does his homework an d calls it easy or boring, you te ach him
to find ways to m ake it more fu n and challenging. If he has to write words,
like boy ,  you ask him, â€œHow many words can you think of that rhyme with
boy ? W rite them on separate paper and later we can try to make a sentence
that has all the  words.â€ When he finishes his homework, you play that
game: â€œ The boy  threw the toy into the soy sauce.â€ â€œThe girl with the cirl
[curl] at e a pirl [pearl].â€ Eventually , he starts coming up with hi s own ways
to make his homework more challenging.
And itâ€™ s  not just school or spo rts. Y ou encourage the children to talk
about w ays they learned to m ake friends, or ways theyâ€™re learning to
understand and help others. Y ou  want to communicate that feats of intellect
or physical prowess are not all you care about.
For a long time, your son rem ains attracted to the fixed mind set. He
loves the idea that heâ€™ s inherentl y specialâ€”case closed. He doesnâ€™ t love the
idea that he has to work every day for some little gain in skill or knowledge.
Stardom shouldnâ€™ t be so taxing. Y et as the value system in the family shifts
toward t he growth mindset, he wants to be a player . So at first he talks the
talk (squawking), then he walks the walk (balking). Finally , g oing all theway , he becomes the mindset w atchdog. When anyone in the family slips
into fixed-mindset thinking, he delights in catching them. â€œBe careful what
you wish for ,â€ you joke to your spouse.
The fixe d minds et is so very tempting. It seems to promise children a
lifetime of worth, success, and admiration just for sitting there and being
who they are. T hatâ€™ s why it can take a lot of work to make  the growth
mindset flourish where the fixed mindset has taken root.
Ef fort Gone A wry
Sometimes the problem with a child isnâ€™ t too little  ef fort. Itâ€™ s too much.  And
for t he w rong ca use. W eâ€™ve all h eard about schoolchildren who stay up past
midnight every night studying. Or children who are sent to tu tors so they
can outs trip their classmates. These children are working hard, but theyâ€™re
typically not in a growth mindset. Theyâ€™re not focused on love of learning.
Theyâ€™re usually trying to prove themselves to their parents.
And in some ca ses, the parents may like what comes out of this high
ef fort: the grades, the awards, the admission to top schools. Letâ€™ s see how
you would handle this one.
The Dilemma.  Y ou â€™re proud o f your daughter . Sheâ€™ s at the top of her class
and brin ging ho me straight A â€™ s. Sheâ€™ s a flute player studying with the best
teacher in the co untry . And youâ€™re confident sheâ€™ll get into the top private
high sch ool in the city . But every morning before school, she gets an upset
stomach, and some days she throws up. Y ou keep feeding her a blander and
blander diet to soothe her sensitive stomach, but it doesnâ€™ t help. It never
occurs to you that sheâ€™ s a nervous wreck.
When your daughter is diagnosed with an ulcer , it should be a wake-up
call, but you and your spouse remain asleep. Y ou continue to  see it as a
gastrointestinal issue. The doctor , however , insists that you consult a family
counselor . He tells you itâ€™ s a m andatory part of your daughter â€™ s treatment
and hands you a card with the counselor â€™ s name and number .
The Fixed-Mindset Reactions.  The  counselor tells you to ease up on your
daughter: Let her know itâ€™ s oka y not to work so hard. Make su re she gets
more sle ep. So you, dutifully following the instructions, make sure she getsto sleep by ten oâ€™clock each nig ht. But this only makes things  worse. She
now has less time to accomplish all the things that are expected of her .
Despite what the counselor has  said, it doesnâ€™ t occur to you that she
could possibly want your daughter to fall behind other students. Or be less
accomplished at  the flute. Or risk not getting into the top high school. How
could that be good for her?
The counselor realizes she has a big job. Her first goal is to get you
more ful ly in touch with the seriousness of the problem. The se cond goal is
to get you to understand your role in the problem. Y ou and your spouse
need to see that  itâ€™ s your  nee d for perfection that has led to the problem.
Y our dau ghter w ouldnâ€™ t have run herself ragged if she hadnâ€™ t been afraid of
losing your approval. The third goal is to work out a concrete plan that you
can all follow .
Can you  think of some concrete things that can be done to help your
daughter enter a growth mindset so she can ease up and get some pleasure
from her life?
The Growth-Mindset Step.  The plan the counselor suggests would allow
your dau ghter to start enjoying t he things she does. The flute lessons are put
on hold. Y our daughter is told she can practice as much or as little as she
wants for the pure joy of the music and nothing else.
She is to study her school materials to learn from them, not to cram
everything poss ible into her hea d. The counselor refers her to a tutor who
teaches her how to study for u nderstanding. The tutor also discusses the
material with her in a way that makes it interesting and enjoyable. Studying
now has  a new m eaning. It isnâ€™ t about getting the highest grade to prove her
intelligence and worth to her parents. Itâ€™ s about learning things and thinking
about them in interesting ways.
Y our daughter â€™ s teachers are brought into the loop to support her in her
reorientation tow ard growth. Theyâ€™re asked to talk to her about (and praise
her for) her learning process ra ther than how she did on tests. (â€œI can see
that you really understand how to use metaphors in your writing.â€ â€œI can
see that you were really into your project on the Incas. When I read it, I felt
as though I were in ancient Peru.â€) Y ou are taught to talk to her this way
too.Finally , the counselor strongly ur ges that your daughter attend  a high
school that is less pressured tha n the one you have your eye on . There are
other fin e schools that focus mo re on learning and less on grades and test
scores. Y ou take your daughter around and spend time in each of the
schools. Then she discusses with you and the counselor which ones she was
most excited about and felt most at ease in.
Slowly , you learn to separate y our needs and desires from he rs. Y ou
may hav e neede d a daughter wh o was number one in everythin g, but your
daughter needed something else : acceptance from her parents and freedom
to g row . As yo u let go, your daughter becomes much mor e genuinely
involved in the things she does. She does them for interest and le arning, and
she does them very well indeed.
Is yo ur child try ing to tell you something you donâ€™ t want to he ar? Y ou
know the ad that asks, â€œDo you know where your child is no w?â€ If you
canâ€™ t he ar what your child is try ing to tell youâ€”in words or actionsâ€”then
you donâ€™ t know where your child is. Enter the growth mindset and listen
harder .
MINDSET AND WILLPOWER
Sometimes we donâ€™ t want to change ourselves very much. W e just want to
be a ble to drop some pounds and keep them of f. Or stop smoking. Or
control our anger .
Some people think about this in  a fixed-mindset way . If youâ€™re strong
and hav e willpo wer , you can do it. But if youâ€™re weak and donâ€™ t have
willpower , you canâ€™ t. People wh o think this way may firmly resolve to do
something, but theyâ€™ll take no special measures to make sure they succeed.
These are the p eople who end up saying, â€œQuitting is easy . Iâ€™ve done it a
hundred times.â€
Itâ€™ s just like the  chemistry students we talked about before. T he ones
with the fixed-mindset thought: â€œIf I have ability , Iâ€™ll do well; if I donâ€™ t, I
wonâ€™ t.â€ As a result, they di dnâ€™ t use sophisticated strategi es to help
themselves. They just studied in an earnest but superficial way  and hoped
for the best.
When people with a fixed mind set fail their testâ€”in chemistry , dieting,
smoking, or angerâ€”they beat themselves up. Theyâ€™re incompetent, weak,or bad people. Where do you go from there?
My frien d Nathanâ€™ s twenty-fifth high school reunion was coming up,
and when he thought about how his ex-girlfriend would be there, he decided
to lo se th e paunch. Heâ€™d been handsome and fit in high school a nd he didnâ€™ t
want to show up as a fat middle-aged man.
Nathan had always made fun of women and their diets. Whatâ€™ s the big
fuss? Y o u just need some self-control. T o lose the weight, he decided he
would just eat part of what was on his plate. But each time he got into a
meal, the food o n the plate disap peared. â€œI blew it!â€ heâ€™d say , feeling like a
failure and ordering dessertâ€”either to seal the failure or to lift his mood.
Iâ€™d s ay , â€œNathan, this isnâ€™ t working. Y ou need a better system. W hy not
put some of the  meal aside at the beginning or have the restau rant wrap it
up to  tak e home? Why not fill y our plate with extra vegetables, so itâ€™ll look
like mor e food? There are lots of things you can do.â€ T o this he  would say ,
â€œNo, I have to be strong.â€
Nathan ended up going on one of those liquid crash diets, losing weight
for the reunion, and putting back  more than he lost afterward. I wasnâ€™ t sure
how this was being strong, and how using some simple strategies was being
weak.
Next time you try to diet, think of Nathan and remember that willpower
is not just a thin g you have or donâ€™ t have. W illpower needs hel p. Iâ€™ll come
back to this point.
Anger
Controlling ang er is something else thatâ€™ s a problem for m any people.
Something triggers their temper and of f they go, losing cont rol of their
mouths or worse. Here, too, people may vow that next time theyâ€™ll be
dif ferent. Anger  control is a big issue between partners and between parents
and chil dren, no t only because p artners and children do things t hat make us
angry , b ut also because we may  think we have a greater right to let loose
when they do. T ry this one.
The Dilemma.  Imagine youâ€™re a nice, caring p ersonâ€”as you probably are
â€”usually . Y ou love your spou se and feel lucky to have them as your
partner . But when they violate one of your rules, like letting the garbageoverflow before taking it out, you feel personally betrayed and start
criticizing. It begins with â€œIâ€™ve told you a thousand times,â€ then moves on
to â€œ Y ou never do anything rig ht.â€ When they still donâ€™ t see m properly
ashamed, you flare, insulting their intelligence (â€œMaybe you arenâ€™ t smart
enough to remember garbageâ€) and their character (â€œIf you werenâ€™ t so
irresponsible, yo u wouldnâ€™ t . . .â€ â€œIf you cared about anyone b ut yourself,
youâ€™d . . .â€). See thing with rage, you then bring in everything yo u can think
of to support your case: â€œMy father never trusted you, either ,â€ or â€œY our boss
was righ t when he said you were limited.â€ Y our spouse has to leave the
premises to get out of range of your mounting fury .
The Fixed-Mindset Reaction.  Y ou feel righteous about your anger for a
while, but then you realize youâ€™ve gone too far . Y ou suddenly recall all the
ways tha t your spouse is a suppo rtive partner and feel intensely guilty . Then
you talk  yourself back into the idea that you, too, are a good person, whoâ€™ s
just slip ped upâ€”lost itâ€”temporarily . â€œIâ€™ve really learned my lesson,â€ you
think. â€œIâ€™ll never do this again.â€
But beli eving yo u can simply k eep that good person in the forefront in
the futur e, you donâ€™ t think of str ategies you could use next time to prevent a
flare-up. Thatâ€™ s why the next time is a carbon copy of the time before.
The Growth Mindset and Self-Control
Some people think about losing weight or controlling their anger in a
growth-mindset way . They realize that to succeed, theyâ€™ll need to learn and
practice strategies that work for them.
Itâ€™ s like the growth-mindset chemistry students. They used better study
techniques, carefully planned th eir study time, and kept up their motivation.
In other  words, they used ev ery strategy possible to make sure they
succeeded.
Just like  them, people in a growth mindset donâ€™ t merely make New
Y ear â€™ s resolutions and wait to see if they stick to them. They understand
that to diet, they need to plan. They may need to keep dessert s out of the
house. Or think in advance abou t what to order in restaurants. Or schedule a
once-a-week splur ge. Or consider exercising more.They think actively about maint enance. What habits must they develop
to continue the gains theyâ€™ve achieved?
Then there are t he setbacks. They know that setbacks will hap pen. So
instead of beating themselves u p, they ask: â€œWhat can I learn from this?
What wi ll I do next time when I â€™m in this situation?â€ Itâ€™ s a learning process
â€”not a battle between the bad you and the good you.
In th at l ast episo de, what could you have done with your ange r? First,
think about why  y ou got so wo rked up. Y ou may have felt devalued and
disrespected wh en your spouse shirked the tasks or broke you r rulesâ€”as
though they were saying to you, â€œY ouâ€™re not important. Y ou r needs are
trivial. I canâ€™ t be bothered.â€
Y our fir st reaction was to angril y remind them of their duty . But on the
heels of that was your retaliation, sort of â€œOkay big shot, if you think youâ€™re
so important, try this on for size.â€
Y our spouse, rather than reassuring you of your importance, simply
braced for the o nslaught. Meanwhile, you took the silence as ev idence that
they felt superior , and it fueled your escalation.
What can be do ne? Several things. First, spouses canâ€™ t read you r mind,
so w hen an anger -provoking situation arises, you have to matter -of-factly
tell them how it makes you feel. â€œIâ€™m not sure why , but when you do that, it
makes m e feel unimportant. Li ke you canâ€™ t be bothered to do things that
matter to me.â€
They , in  turn, can reassure you  that they care about how you feel and
will try to be m ore watchful. (â€œAre you kidding?â€ you say . â€œ My spouse
would never do that.â€ W ell, you can request it directly , as Iâ€™ve sometimes
done: â€œP lease tell me that you care how I feel and youâ€™ll try to be more
watchful.â€)
When you feel yourself losing it, you can learn to leave the room and
write down your ugliest thoughts, followed by what is probably r eally
happening (â€œShe  doesnâ€™ t understand this is important to me,â€ â€œHe doesnâ€™ t
know what to do when I start to  blowâ€). When you feel calm enough, you
can return to the situation.
Y ou can  also learn to loosen up  on some of your rules, now t hat each
one is not a tes t of your partner â€™ s respect for you. W ith time , you might
even gain a sense of humor about them. For example, if your sp ouse leaves
some socks in t he living room or puts the wrong things in th e recyclingbins, you might point at the of fending items and ask sternly , â€œWhat is the
meaning of this?â€ Y ou might even have a good laugh.
When people drop the goodâ€“ba d, strongâ€“weak thinking that grows out
of th e fi xed min dset, theyâ€™re better able to learn useful strategies that help
with sel f-control. Every lapse doesnâ€™ t spell doom. Itâ€™ s like anything else in
the grow th mind set. Itâ€™ s a remin der that youâ€™re an unfinished human being
and a clue to how to do it better next time.
MAINT AINING CHANGE
Whether people change their mindset in order to further their career , heal
from a loss, help their children thrive, lose weight, or control their anger ,
change needs to be maintained . Itâ€™ s amazingâ€”once a problem improves,
people often stop doi ng what  caused it to impr ove.  Once you feel better ,
you stop taking your medicine.
But change doesnâ€™ t work that w ay . When youâ€™ve lost weight, t he issue
doesnâ€™ t go away . Or when your child starts to love learning, t he problem
isnâ€™ t solved forever . Or when you and your partner start com municating
better , thatâ€™ s not the end of it. These changes have to be supported or they
can go away faster than they appeared.
Maybe t hatâ€™ s why Alcoholics Anonymous tells people they will always
be a lcoholicsâ€”s o they wonâ€™ t become complacent and stop doing what they
need to do to stay sober . Itâ€™ s a way of saying, â€œY ouâ€™ll always be
vulnerable.â€
This is why min dset change is n ot about picking up a few tricks. In fact,
if someone stays inside a fixed mindset and uses the growth strategies, it
can backfire.
W es, a dad with  a fixed mindset , was at his witâ€™ s end. Heâ€™d come home
exhausted from work every evening and his son, Mickey , wou ld refuse to
cooperate. W es wanted quiet, but Mickey was noisy . W es would warn him,
but Mickey would continue wh at he was doing. W es found him stubborn,
unruly , and not respectful of W esâ€™ s rights as a father . The whole scene
would d isintegrate into a shouting match and Mickey would e nd up being
punished.
Finally , feeling he had nothing to lose, W es tried some of the growth-
oriented strategi es. He showed respect for Mickeyâ€™ s ef forts and praised hisstrategies when he was empath ic or helpful. The turnaround in Mickeyâ€™ s
behavior was dramatic.
But as soon as the turnaround took place, W es stopped using the
strategies. He had what he wante d and he expected it to just con tinue. When
it didnâ€™ t, he bec ame even angrier and more punitive than before. Mickey
had shown he could  behave and now refused to.
The same thing often happens  with fixed-mindset couples who start
communicating better . Marlene and Scott were what my husband and I call
the Bick ersons. All they did was bicker: â€œWhy donâ€™ t you ever pick up after
yourself?â€ â€œI might if you were nâ€™ t such a nag.â€ â€œI wouldnâ€™ t have to nag if
you did what yo u were supposed to do.â€ â€œWho made you  the judge of what
Iâ€™m  supposed to do?â€
W ith counseling, Marlene and Scott stopped jumping on the negatives.
More an d more, they started re warding the thoughtful things their partner
did a nd the ef for ts their partner m ade. The love and tenderness t hey thought
were de ad returned. But once it returned, they reverted. In the fixed
mindset, things shouldnâ€™ t need  such ef fort. Good people sho uld just act
good and good relationships should just unfold in a good way .
When t he bickering resumed,  it was fiercer than ever because it
reflected all of their disappointed hopes.
Mindset change  is not about picking up a few pointers here an d there.
Itâ€™ s about seeing things in a new way . When peopleâ€”couples, coaches and
athletes, manage rs and workers, parents and children, teachers and students
â€”change to a g rowth mindset,  they change from a judge-and-be-judged
framework to a learn-and-help-learn  framework. Their commitment is to
growth, and growth takes plenty of time, ef fort, and mutual support to
achieve and maintain.
THE JOURNEY T O A (TRUE) GROWTH MINDSET
In chapter 7 , I  talked about the â€œfalse grow th mindset.â€ If you remember ,
my colleague Susan Mackie was encountering people who claimed to have
a gro wth mindset but who, upon closer inspection, did not. Once alerted, I
started seeing false growth mindset everywhere and I understood why it
was happening. Everyone wants  to seem enlightened, in the know . Maybeâ– 
â– 
â– as a parent, ed ucator , coach, or business professional, having a growth
mindset was expected or admired.
Or maybe it was my fault. Did I make the change to a growth mindset
seem too  easy , so that people di dnâ€™ t realize that a journey was required? Or
maybe people didnâ€™ t know how to take the journey . So letâ€™ s talk more about
that journey .
The Journey: Step 1
Y ouâ€™ll be surprised to hear me say this. The first step is to embrace your
fixed mindset.  Let â€™ s face it, we all have some  of it. W eâ€™re all a mixture of
growth and fixed mindsets and  we need to acknowledge tha t. Itâ€™ s not a
shameful admission. Itâ€™ s more like, welcome to the human rac e. But even
though w e have to accept that some fixed mindset dwells within, we do not
have to accept how often it shows up and how much havoc i t can wreak
when it does.
The Journey: Step 2
The second step is to become a ware of your fixed-mindset triggers. When
does your fixed-mindset â€œpersonaâ€ come home to roost?
It could be when youâ€™re thinking about taking on a big, new
challenge. Y our fixed-mindset persona might appear and
whisper , â€œMaybe you donâ€™ t have what it takes, and everyone
will find out.â€
It could be when youâ€™re struggling with something and you keep
hitting dead ends. Y our fixed-mindset persona might fly in and
of fer its advice: â€œGive it up. Itâ€™ s just making you feel frustrated
and ashamed. Do something easier .â€
How about when you feel like youâ€™ve failed decisively? Lost
your job. Lost a cherished relationship. Messed up in a very big
way . Itâ€™ s a rare person who doesnâ€™ t have a fixed-mindset
episode. And we all know very well what that fixed mindset
says to us: â€œY ouâ€™re not the person you thought you wereâ€”and
you never will be.â€â– 
â– What about when you encounter someone whoâ€™ s a lot better than
you in the very area you pride yourself on? What does that
fixed-mindset voice say to you? Does it tell you that youâ€™ll never
be as good? Does it make you hate that person just a little?
What about our fixed mindset toward others? If weâ€™re educators,
what happens after a high-stakes test? Do we judge whoâ€™ s smart
and who isnâ€™ t? If weâ€™re managers, what happens during and after
a big project? Do we judge our employeesâ€™ talent? If weâ€™re
parents, do we pressure our kids to prove theyâ€™re smarter than
others and make them feel judged based on their grades and test
scores?
Think a bout it. Whatâ€™ s a recent time you were triggered into a fixed
mindset? What happened to summon your fixed-mindset person a? What did
it whisper in your ear , and how did it make you feel?
When I  asked people to tell me when their fixed-mindset persona
usually shows up, hereâ€™ s what they said:
â€œWhen Iâ€™m under pressure, my fixed-mindset persona appears. He
fills my head with noise and ke eps me from paying attention to  the
work I have to do. Then I feel like I canâ€™ t accomplish anyth ing.
Feelings of anxiety and sadness also attract him. He attempts to
weaken me when Iâ€™m already feeling down. He makes comments
like â€˜Y ou donâ€™ t h ave the ability t o grasp dif ficult concepts. Y ou have
reached your limit.â€™ â€ (By the way , this was a woman who thought
of her fixed-mindset persona as a male.)
â€œWhenever I demonstrate my laziness through procrastina tion,
whenever I have a disagreemen t with someone, whenever Iâ€™m too
shy to talk to an yone at a party , my fixed mindset persona shows  up.
. . . H e t ells me, â€˜Y our F AILUR E doesnâ€™ t define you.â€™ Of course , he
yells the word â€˜failure,â€™ and whispers the rest.â€
â€œWhenever I fail to live up to the image that sheâ€”my fixed-mindset
personaâ€”concocted for me, she makes me feel stressed, defensive,
and unmotivated . She doesnâ€™ t al low me to take risks that may a f fectour reputation as a successful p erson. She doesnâ€™ t let me speak  out
for fear of being wrong. She forces me to look like a person who can
understand and do everything ef fortlessly .â€
â€œWhen we have a work deadline and my team is under the gun, my
fixed-mindset persona sits in judgment. Instead of empowering my
team, I become a harping perfectionistâ€”no one is doing it right, no
one is working f ast enough. Where are all those breakthrough ideas?
W eâ€™ll never make it. As a result, I often just take over and do a lot of
the work myself. Needless to say , it doesnâ€™ t do wonders for team
morale.â€ (W e will hear more from this team leader and one o f his
team members in a moment.)
As you come to understand your triggers and get to know your persona,
donâ€™ t judge it. Just observe it.
The Journey: Step 3
Now give your fixed-mindset persona a name.
Y ou heard me correctly .
I wa tched as Su san Mackie worked with financial executives who had
given th eir fixed-mindset personas names. They were talking about what
triggers their personas, and the top guy said, â€œWhen weâ€™re in a crunch,
Duane s hows up . He makes me  supercritical of everyone, and I get bossy
and dem anding rather than supportive.â€ A female team member quickly
responded: â€œY es , and when your Duane shows up, my Ianni comes roaring
out. Ianni is th e macho guy w ho makes me feel incompetent. So your
Duane brings out my Ianni and I become cowering and anxious, which
infuriates Duane.â€ And on went this amazing conversation. These
sophisticated professionals talked about when their named persona showed
up, how it made  them feel and act, and how it af fected others a round them.
By the way , once they were able to understand each other â€™ s triggers and
personas, they could move their  interactions to another level and the morale
in this unit went up by leaps and bounds.
Every fall I teach a freshman seminarâ€”sixteen brand-new Stanford
students, very eager and very nervous. Each week I give them a dif ferentassignment for a short paper: Find something important about yourself that
youâ€™d lik e to change and take the first step. . . . Do something outrageously
growth mindset in the service of what youâ€™d like to change. . . . Project
yourself twenty-five years into the future and write me a letter about where
you are in your  life and all the struggles, disappointments, hardships, and
failures youâ€™ve encountered along the way .
This yea r I tried a new one. In the past, I had assigned a pa per that
asked students to reflect on the ir mindsets, and Iâ€™d always had a few of
them laying claim to a long-standing and total growth mindset. But this year
I ask ed t hem to identify their fixed-mindset triggers and to give their fixed-
mindset persona  a name. It was fascinating. Not one student  claimed to
have no triggers  or persona. All  of them were able to write eloq uently (and
painfully) about their fixed-mindset persona, its triggers, and its impact.
â€œMeet G ertrude, my cagey , histrionic, self-aggrandizing fixed-
mindset persona. She sneaks into my subconscious and undermines
me. The name Gertrude means â€˜strong spear ,â€™ which reflects her
insistence on unwavering, natural strength. She detests hard work,
second place, and imperfections. Any whif f of failure or
imperfection can  trigger Gertrudeâ€™ s entrance. Three seconds slo wer
in a swim race? No shot at the v arsity team . Did nâ€™ t draw as  good a
self-portrait as another girl in my class? Art isnâ€™ t your thing.
Couldnâ€™ t use as many big words as my older sister? Y ouâ€™ll never be
as smar t as her . Ge rtrude convinces me that f ailure is definitive.
One mistake can take away my future success.â€
â€œAlmost like marriage, I know S ugardaddy will be with me through
thick an d thin, sickness and health, and life and death. He co mes
forth when I s tep out of my comfort zone, get criticized , or
experience a failure, causing me to become defensive, lash out at
others, or stagnate. Sugardaddy  finds peace in never leaving his
comfort zone, but his views conflict more and more with mine a s his
rigid guidelines try to keep me boxed in his stand-still world.â€
â€œFailure, especially public failure, is my main fixed-mindset trigger .
Thatâ€™ s when Henrietta comes o ut. She is my critical grandmother ,and in the fixed mindset I remind myself more of her than Iâ€™d care
to admit . My Henrietta persona is quick to blame others to pres erve
her ego.  She rejects failure instead of embracing it, and makes me
worry that if anyone ever sees me fail they will deem me a failure.â€
â€œMy fix ed-mindset persona is Z, the mirror image of my first initial,
S . Z show s up when I least requi re her , like after a failed attempt, a
rejection, or a m issed opportunity . Iâ€™ve always been an avid writ erâ€”
the editor of my high school newsletter and the author of a now-
published novel. So when the c hance to be a part of The Stanfor d
Daily  [ the school ne wspaper] arrive d, I was thrilled to apply . I
worked very hard on the essay s for the application and felt they
were well written. Thus, when I awoke to the thundering knocks at 7
a.m. on a Frida y morning and I heard the screaming of â€˜Stanfor d
Daily ,â€™  my hea rt skipped a happy beat. As my roommate opened the
door , the reps f rom the newspaper yelled out, â€˜W elcome to The
Stanfor d Daily . â€™ T o her . As this  happened, Z w as screaming too, but
it w as â€˜Stupid, s tupid, stupid. How could you think youâ€™re cap able
of getting into the Daily ?â€™ Z  was espec ially ferocious since my
roommate spent  exactly half an  hour on her essays and even a sked
me for ideas for them.â€ (P .S. For a later assignmentâ€”to do
something â€œoutrageously growth mindsetâ€â€”S actually contacted
The Stanfor d Daily  to  see i f they needed any new writers. They did
and she got the job! I am still th rilled by her courage in the face of
the painful rejection.)
â€œAnything that triggers self-doubt triggers my fixed mindset, which
triggers more self-doubt. Iâ€™ve decided to name my doubt guy Dale
Denton, Seth Rogenâ€™ s character in Pineapple Expr ess . Picturing my
fixed mi ndset as a lazy , bumblin g slob of a guy sitting in the corner
of my brain hel ps me battle against him. Dale produces a con stant
stream of doubt-provoking statements. Whispers of â€˜What if you
can never repeat that success?â€™ trail behind every successful
outcome. And when an endeavo r veers in the wrong direction, Dale
is always present to help the doubt blossom.â€T ake a moment to think carefu lly about your own fixed-mindset persona.
W ill you  name it after someone in your life? A character from a book or a
movie? W ill you give it your middle nameâ€”itâ€™ s part of you but not the
main part of you? Or perhaps you might give it a name you d onâ€™ t like, to
remind you that thatâ€™ s not the person you want to be.
The Journey: Step 4
Y ouâ€™re in touch with your triggers and youâ€™re excruciatingly aware of your
fixed-mindset persona and what  it does to you. It has a name. W hat happens
now? Educate it. T ake it on the journey with you.
The mor e you become aware o f your fixed-mindset triggers, the more
you can be on the lookout for t he arrival of your persona. If youâ€™re on the
ver ge of stepping out of your comfort zone, be ready to greet it when it
shows up and warns you to stop. Thank it for its input, but then tell it why
you want to take this step and ask it to come along with you: â€œLook, I know
this may  not work out, but Iâ€™d really like to take a stab at it. Can  I count on
you to bear with me?â€
When yo u hit a setback, the cha nces are excellent itâ€™ s going to show up
again. Donâ€™ t suppress it or ban it. Just let it do its thing. Let it do its song
and dance, and when it settles down a bit, talk to it about how you plan to
learn from the s etback and go forward: â€œY es, yes, itâ€™ s possible that Iâ€™m not
so good at this ( yet), but I think I have an idea of what to do next. Letâ€™ s just
try it.â€
When y ouâ€™re under pressure and youâ€™re afraid your team will let you
down, tell them that Duane is in full bloom and ask them wha t they need
from you to do their best work. T ry to understand and respect where they
are and what theyâ€™re thinking, and try to support and guide them. Keep
talking to Duane so he can calm  downâ€”and then help you cut them some
slack and contribute to team process.
Remember that your fixed-mindset persona was born to protect you and
keep you  safe. But it has developed some very limiting ways of doing that.
So educ ate it in the new growt h mindset ways that it can support you: in
taking on challenges and sticking to them, bouncing back from failure, and
helping and supporting others t o grow . Understand the personaâ€™ s point ofâ– 
â– view , bu t slowly teach it a dif ferent way of thinking, and take it with you on
your journey to a growth mindset.
Understanding t hat everyone has a fixed-mindset persona can give us
more co mpassion for people. It allows us to understand their struggles. I
mentioned in a previous chap ter how upset I was to learn that some
educators were scolding children for acting in fixed-mindset ways. They
would point to the mindset chart in the front of the room and tell the kids to
shape up.
Compare this to the following teacher . Over a period of ti me, this
teacher had her grade school c lass talk about their fixed-mindset triggers
and then give th eir personas a name. One boy wouldnâ€™ t do it, which was
very much in li ne with a lot of his behavior . There were man y things he
wouldnâ€™ t do no matter how much the teacher gently encourag ed him. For
weeks h e sat there mute while every other student in the class t alked about
and drew  picture s of their little fixed-mindset personasâ€”Scared Sally , Lazy
Larry , A nxious Andy , or Helpless Hannah. But the teacher le t him know
that she was there for him whenever he was ready , and one day , out of
nowhere, he said, â€œDumping Dan.â€ â€œWhat?â€ the teacher asked. â€œDumping
Dan,â€ h e repeated. â€œWhenever I do something, I do it wrong. I canâ€™ t do
anything right. Thatâ€™ s why ever yone dumps on me.â€ Whenever he tried to
do h is schoolwork, it seemed that Dumping Dan would yel l at him so
loudly th at he couldnâ€™ t proceed.  The teacher rushed to his side and worked
with him  and Dumping Dan so t hat eventually Dan relented, gave him some
peace, and allowed him to work. After that, his growth was tremendous.
How many students or employees are considered incompetent,
stubborn, or defiant when they just donâ€™ t know how to function well under
the c urrent conditions? How ofte n do we threaten, punish, or write of f these
people r ather th an helping them work it through or helping them find the
conditions under which they can thrive?
Every one of us has a journey to take.
It starts by accepting that we all have both mindsets.
Then we learn to recognize what triggers our fixed mindset.
Failures? Criticism? Deadlines? Disagreements?â– 
â– 
â– And we come to understand what happens to us when our fixed-
mindset â€œpersonaâ€ is triggered. Who is this persona? Whatâ€™ s its
name? What does it make us think, feel, and do? How does it
af fect those around us?
Importantly , we can gradually learn to remain in a growth-
mindset place despite the triggers, as we educate our persona
and invite it to join us on our growth-mindset journey .
Ideally , we will learn more and more about how we can help
others on their journey , too.
LEARN AND HELP LEARN
Letâ€™ s say youâ€™ve named and t amed your fixed-mindset persona. Thatâ€™ s
great, but please donâ€™ t think your journey is complete. For your growth
mindset to bear fruit, you need  to keep setting goalsâ€”goals for growth.
Every day presents you with wa ys to grow and to help the peop le you care
about grow . How can you remember to look for these chances?
First, ma ke a copy of this graph ic summary of the two mindset s, which
was cre ated by the wonderful Nigel Holmes, and tape it to y our mirror .
Each morning, use it to remind yourself of the dif ferences between the fixed
and growth mindsets. Then, as y ou contemplate the day in fron t of you, try
to ask yourself t hese questions. If you have room on your mirror , copy them
over and tape them there, too.
What ar e the opportunities for learning and gr owth today? For
myself? For the people ar ound me?
As you think of opportunities, form a plan, and ask:
When, wher e, and how will I embark on my plan?
When, wher e,  and how  m ake the plan c oncrete. How  asks you to think of all
the ways to bring your plan to life and make it work.
As you encounter the inevitable obstacles and setbacks, form a new plan
and ask yourself the question again:When, wher e, and how will I act on my new plan?
Regardless of how bad you may  feel, chat with your fixed-mindset persona
and then do it!
And when you succeed, donâ€™ t for get to ask yourself:
What do I have to do to maintain and continue the gr owth?
Remember , as Alex Rodriguez, the baseball player , wisely sai d: â€œY ou
either go one way or the other .â€ Y ou might as well be the one deciding thedirection.
THE ROAD AHEAD
Change can be tough, but Iâ€™ve never heard anyone say it wasn â€™ t worth it.
Maybe t heyâ€™re just rationalizin g, the way people whoâ€™ve gone through a
painful i nitiation say it was wo rth it. But people whoâ€™ve chan ged can tell
you how  their lives have been enhanced. They can tell you a bout things
they have now that they wouldnâ€™ t have had, and ways they feel now that
they wouldnâ€™ t have felt.
Did changing toward a growth mindset solve all my problems? No. But
I k now that I ha ve a dif ferent lif e because of itâ€”a richer one. And that Iâ€™m
a more alive, courageous, and open person because of it.
Itâ€™ s f or you to decide whether change is right for you now . May be it is,
maybe i t isnâ€™ t. But either way , keep the growth mindset in yo ur thoughts.
Then, when you bump up against obstacles, you can turn to it. It will always
be there for you, showing you a path into the future.3

In the 1960s, psychiatrist Aaron Beck:  A aron T . Beck , â€œThinking and
Depression: Idiosyncratic Content and Cognitive Distortions,â€ Ar chives of
General Psychology  9 (1963), 325â€“333; Prisoners of Hate: The Cognitive B asis

the key to how people feel.)
In several studies, we probed:  T his work was d one with Y ing-yi Hong, C. Y .
Chiu, and Russell Sacks.
It do es not confro nt the basic:  However , see Jef frey E. Y oung and Janet Klosko,
Reinventing Y our Life  (Ne w Y ork: Plume/Penguin, 1994). Although Y oung and
Klosko a re workin g in a cognitive therapy tradition, a core assumption  of their
approach and one that they teach th eir clients is that people can change in very
basic ways.
A Mindset W orkshop:  This workshop was developed with Lisa Sorich Blackwell
with gran ts from the W illiam T . Gran t Foundation and the Spencer Found ation: L.
S. Blackwell, C. S. Dweck, and K. T rzesniewski, Implicit Theories of Intelligence
Pr edict A chievement Acr oss an Adolescent T ransition: A Longitudinal Study and
an Intervention,  2003. I would also like to acknowledge other psychologists who
have developed their own student workshops based on the growth mindset: Jef f
Howard, founder of the Ef ficacy Ins titute, and Joshua Aronson, Catherine Good,
and Michael Inzlicht of New Y ork University and Columbia University .
â€œMany people think of the brainâ€:  This was written for the workshop by Lisa
Sorich Blackwell.
Brainology:  The Brainology computer -based program was also developed with
Lisa Sorich Blackwell, with a grant from the W illiam T . Grant Foundation.
Psychologists Karen Horney and Carl Rogers:  Karen Horney , Neur osis and
Human Gr owth: The Struggle T owar d Self-Realization  (Ne w Y ork: Norton,
1950); Our Inne r Conflicts: A Constructive Theory of Neur osis  (New Y ork:

Research by Peter Gollwitzer:  Pete r M. Gollwitz er , â€œImplementation Intentions:
Strong Ef fects of Simple Plans,â€ American Psychologist  54 (1999), 493â€“503.
Mindset and W illpower:  I am researching this issue with Abigail Scholer , Eran
Magen, and James Gross.
Some people think about this:  See the recent research by V eronika Job and
colleagues (e.g., V . Job, G. M. W alton, K. Bernecker , and C. S. Dweck, â€œImplicit
Theories About W illpower Predict Self-Regulation and Grades in Everyday Life,â€
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  108 [2015], 637â€“647).
